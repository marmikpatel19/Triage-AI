RE:		2024.1 Statewide Treatment Protocols (STPs)
DATE:		January 22, 2024
______________________________________________________________________________

The Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Office of Emergency Medical Services (the Department) is issuing the 2024.1 Updated Statewide Treatment Protocols.

As a reminder, the PDF edition continues to be hyperlinked.  The Table of Contents is hyperlinked to each individual protocol.  Additionally, within each protocol, when a reference is made to another protocol that, too, is hyperlinked to the appropriate protocol.  Finally, the number of the protocol at the top of each page is hyperlinked back to the Table of Contents. 

All ambulance services are required to train their EMS personnel in the updated protocols.  The updated protocols may be used by a service once such training is complete, and the service is appropriately equipped, but in any event are mandatory as of April 22, 2024.

The change chart is below:
