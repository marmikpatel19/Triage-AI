Version 3.0

Introduction
We are honored to present the third edition of the National Association of State EMS Officials (NASEMSO)
National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines and want to thank the entire EMS community for contributing to its
evolution. The inaugural edition, released in September 2014, has been warmly welcomed by EMS
clinicians, agencies, medical directors, and healthcare organizations in our nation as well as abroad. The
creation of this document is a pinnacle event in the practice of EMS medicine as it fulfilled a
recommendation in The Future of Emergency Care: Emergency Medical Services at the Crossroads published
by the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academies of Sciences) in 2007. Specifically, this report
states “NHTSA, in partnership with professional organizations, should convene a panel of individuals with
multidisciplinary expertise to develop evidence-based model prehospital care protocols for the treatment,
triage, and transport of patients.”
The National Association of State EMS Officials (NASEMSO) recognizes the need for national EMS clinical
guidelines to help state EMS systems ensure a more standardized approach to the practice of patient care
now and, as experience dictates, the adoption of future practices. The value of EMS clinicians to the patient
has no boundaries as magnified by the historic 2019 novel coronavirus pandemic as well as other
interjurisdictional and global responses. Model EMS clinical guidelines promote uniformity in EMS medicine
which, in turn, fosters a more consistent skilled practice as EMS clinicians move across healthcare
systems. They also provide a standard to EMS medical directors upon which to base practice. Supported by
initial and subsequent grant funding from NHTSA’s Office of Emergency Medical Services (OEMS) and the
Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Maternal and Child Health Bureau’s EMS for Children
program, NASEMSO continues to authorize its Medical Directors Council to partner with national
stakeholder organizations with expertise in EMS medical direction and subject matter experts to create a
unified set of patient care guidelines. For those aspects of clinical care where evidence-based guidelines
derived in accordance with the national evidence-based guideline model process were not available,
consensus-based clinical guidelines are developed utilizing current available research.
The NASEMSO Model EMS Clinical Guidelines are not mandatory, are not meant to be all-inclusive, nor are
they meant to determine local scope of practice. The focus of these guidelines is solely patient-centric. As
such, they are designed to provide a resource for EMS clinical practice, appropriate patient care, safety of
patients and clinicians, and outcomes regardless of the existing resources and capabilities within an EMS
system. This document provides a clinical standard that can be used as is or adapted for use on a state,
regional, local, or organizational level to enhance patient care and to set benchmark performance of EMS
practice. The Guidelines should be adapted to align with federal, state, regional, and jurisdictional laws and
regulations. NASEMSO’s ongoing support of this project underlines the critical evolution of the model EMS
clinical guidelines as new EMS research and evidence-based patient care measures emerge.
We are most grateful to be able to partner with a group of talented, committed individuals in this
worthwhile endeavor.

National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines

Version 3.0

Purpose and Notes
These guidelines are intended to help state EMS systems ensure a more standardized approach to the
practice of patient care, and to encompass evidence-based guidelines (EBG) as they are developed.
The long-term goal is to develop a full range of evidence-based clinical guidelines for the practice of EMS
medicine. However, until there is a sufficient body of evidence to fully support this goal, there is a need for
this interim expert, consensus-based step.
The National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines can fill a significant gap in uniform clinical guidance for EMS
patient care, while also providing input to the evidence-based guideline (EBG) development process.
These guidelines will be maintained by the Medical Directors Council of the National Association of State
EMS Officials (NASEMSO) and will be reviewed and updated periodically. As EBG material is developed, it
will be substituted for the consensus-based guidelines now comprising the majority of the content of this
document. In the interim, additional consensus-based guidelines will also be added as the need is identified.
For guidelines to be considered for inclusion, they must be presented in the format followed by all
guidelines in the document.
Universal Care and Poisoning/Overdose Universal Care guidelines are included to reduce the need for
extensive reiteration of basic assessment and other considerations in every guideline.
The appendices contain material such as neurologic status assessment and burn assessment tools to which
many guidelines refer to increase consistency in internal standardization and to reduce duplication.
While some specific guidelines have been included for pediatric patients, considerations of patient age and
size (pediatric, geriatric, and bariatric) have been interwoven in the guidelines throughout the document.
Where IV access and drug routing are specified, it is intended to include IO access and drug routing when IV
access and drug routing is not possible.
Generic medication names are utilized throughout the guidelines. A complete list of these, along with
respective brand names, may be found in Appendix III. “Medications”.
Accurate and quality data collection is crucial to the advancement of EMS and a critical element of EMS
research. The National EMS Information System (NEMSIS) has the unique ability to unify EMS data on a
national scope to fulfill this need. Each guideline, therefore, is also listed by the closest NEMSIS Version 3
Label and Code corresponding to it, listed in parentheses below the guideline name.
Quality assurance (QA) and/or continued performance improvement (CPI) programs are an indispensable
element of medical direction as they facilitate the identification of gaps and potential avenues of their
resolution within an EMS system. The National EMS Quality Alliance (NEMSQA) Performance Measures is a
resource for these programs. This edition of the NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines
incorporates many of the NEMSQA performance measures into the key performance measures associated
with each clinical guideline.

Version 3.0

Target Audience
While this material is intended to be integrated into an EMS system’s operational guidance materials by its
medical director and other leaders, it is written with the intention that it will be consumed by field EMS
clinicians.
To the degree possible, it has been assembled in a format useful for guidance and quick reference so that
leaders may adopt it in whole or in part, harvesting and integrating as they deem appropriate to the format
of their guideline, protocol, or procedure materials.
Any set of guidelines must determine a balance between education and patient care. This document
purposefully focuses on the patient care aspect of EMS response. This does not preclude the individual
medical director from using these guidelines and including additional education as well as incorporation of
state, local, or jurisdictional operational procedures.

What is New in the 2022 Edition
All of the 2017 guidelines have been reviewed and updated, and additional guidelines and new evidencebased guidelines have been added to this edition. While some of the new material has been added as
guidelines in the appropriate chapter, other topics have been incorporated into a previously existing
guideline. New guidelines have been added to the 2022 edition for the following clinical conditions or
scenarios:
•
•
•
•

Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) & Acute Events in Infants
Resuscitation in Traumatic Cardiac Arrest
Tracheostomy Management
Trauma Mass Casualty Incident

In addition, with the permission and assistance of the American College of Surgeons – Committee on
Trauma, we have included the 2022 National Guideline for the Field Triage of Injured Patients as Appendix
IX.

a. Airway (assess for patency and open the airway as indicated) – go to Airway Management
Guideline
i. Patient is unable to maintain airway patency—open airway
1. Head tilt/chin lift
2. Jaw thrust
3. Suction
4. Consider use of the appropriate airway management adjuncts and devices: oral
airway, nasal airway, supraglottic airway device or endotracheal tube
5. For patients with laryngectomies or tracheostomies, remove all objects or clothing
that may obstruct the opening of these devices, maintain the flow of prescribed
oxygen, and reposition the head and/or neck
b. Breathing
i. Evaluate rate, breath sounds, accessory muscle use, retractions, patient positioning,
oxygen saturation
ii. Provide supplemental oxygen as appropriate to achieve the target of 94–98% oxygen
saturation (SPO2) based upon clinical presentation and assessment of ventilation (e.g.,
EtCO2)
iii. Apnea (not breathing) – go to Airway Management Guideline
c. Circulation
i. Control any major external bleeding [See General Trauma Management Guideline
and/or Extremity Trauma/External Hemorrhage Management Guideline]
ii. Assess pulse
1. If none – go to Resuscitation Section
2. Assess rate and quality of carotid and radial pulses
iii. Evaluate perfusion by assessing skin color and temperature
1. Evaluate capillary refill
d. Disability
i. Evaluate patient responsiveness: AVPU (Alert, Verbal, Painful, Unresponsive)
ii. Evaluate gross motor and sensory function in all extremities
iii. Check blood glucose in patients with altered mental status (AMS) or suspected stroke. If
blood glucose is less than 60 mg/dL – go to Hypoglycemia Guideline
iv. If acute stroke suspected – go to Suspected Stroke/Transient Ischemic Attack Guideline
e. Expose patient for exam as appropriate to complaint
i. Be considerate of patient modesty
ii. Keep patient warm
6. Assess for urgency of transport
7. Secondary survey
The performance of the secondary survey should not delay transport in critical patients. See
also secondary survey specific to individual complaints in other protocols. Secondary surveys
should be tailored to patient presentation and chief complaint. The following are suggested
considerations for secondary survey assessment:
a. Head
i. Pupils
ii. Ears
iii. Naso-oropharynx
iv. Skull and scalp

b. Neck
i. Jugular venous distension
ii. Tracheal position
iii. Spinal tenderness
c. Chest
i. Retractions
ii. Breath sounds
iii. Chest wall tenderness, deformity, crepitus, and excursion
iv. Respiratory pattern, symmetry of chest movement with respiration
d. Abdomen/Back
i. Tenderness or bruising
ii. Abdominal distension, rebound, or guarding
iii. Spinal tenderness, crepitus, or step-offs
iv. Pelvic stability or tenderness
e. Extremities
i. Pulses
ii. Edema
iii. Deformity/crepitus
f. Neurologic
i. Mental status/orientation
ii. Motor/sensory
g. Evaluate for medical equipment (e.g., pacemaker/defibrillator, left ventricular assist device
(LVAD), insulin pump, dialysis fistula)
8. Obtain baseline vital signs (an initial full set of vital signs is required: pulse, blood pressure,
respiratory rate, neurologic status assessment and obtain pulse oximetry if indicated)
a. Neurologic status assessment [See Appendix VII. Neurologic Status Assessment] involves
establishing a baseline and then trending any change in patient neurologic status
i. Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) is frequently used, but there are often errors in applying and
calculating this score. With this in consideration, a more simple field approach may be
as valid as GCS. Either AVPU or only the motor component of the GCS may more
effectively serve in this capacity
ii. Sternal rub as a stimulus is discouraged
b. Patients with cardiac or respiratory complaints
i. Pulse oximetry
ii. 12-lead electrocardiogram (EKG) should be obtained promptly in patients with cardiac
or suspected cardiac complaints
iii. Continuous cardiac monitoring, if available
iv. Consider waveform capnography for patients with respiratory complaints (essential for
critical patients and those patients who require invasive airway management)
c. Patient with altered mental status
i. Check blood glucose. If low, go to Hypoglycemia Guideline
ii. Consider waveform capnography (essential for critical patients and those patients who
require invasive airway management) or digital capnometry
d. Stable patients should have at least two sets of pertinent vital signs. Ideally, one set should
be taken shortly before arrival at receiving facility
e. Critical patients should have pertinent vital signs frequently monitored

9. Obtain OPQRST history:
a. Onset of symptoms
b. Provocation: location; any exacerbating or alleviating factors
c. Quality of pain
d. Radiation of pain
e. Severity of symptoms: pain scale
f. Time of onset and circumstances around onset
10. Obtain SAMPLE history:
a. Symptoms
b. Allergies: medication, environmental, and foods
c. Medications: prescription and over the counter; bring containers to ED if possible
d. Past medical history
i. Look for medical alert tags, portable medical records, advance directives
ii. Look for medical devices/implants (some common ones may be dialysis shunt, insulin
pump, pacemaker, central venous access port, gastric tubes, urinary catheter)
iii. For females of childbearing age, inquire of potential or recent pregnancy.
e. Last oral intake
f. Events leading up to the 911 call
In patients with syncope, seizure, altered mental status, or acute stroke, consider bringing
the witness to the hospital or obtain their contact phone number to provide to ED care
team
Treatment and Interventions
1. Administer oxygen as appropriate with a target of achieving 94–98% saturation and select the
appropriate method of oxygen delivery to mitigate or treat hypercarbia associated with
hypoventilation
2. Place appropriate monitoring equipment as dictated by assessment; these may include:
a. Continuous pulse oximetry
b. Cardiac rhythm monitoring
c. Waveform capnography or digital capnometry
d. Carbon monoxide assessment
3. Establish vascular access if indicated or in patients who are at risk for clinical deterioration.
a. If IO is to be used for a conscious patient, consider the use of 0.5 mg/kg of lidocaine 0.1
mg/mL with slow push through IO needle to a maximum of 40 mg to mitigate pain from IO
medication administration
4. Monitor pain scale if appropriate
5. Monitor agitation-sedation scale if appropriate
6. Reassess patient
Transfer of Care
1. The content and quality of information provided during the transfer of patient care to
another party is critical for seamless patient care and maintenance of patient safety
2. Ideally, a completed electronic or written medical record should be provided to the next
caregiver at the time of transfer of care

Version 3.0

3. If provision of the completed medical record is not possible at the time of transfer of care, a
verbal report and an abbreviated written run report should be provided to the next caregiver
4. The information provided during the transfer of care should include, but is not limited to,
a. Patient’s full name
b. Age
c. Chief complaint
d. History of present illness/Mechanism of injury
e. Past medical history
f. Medications
g. Allergies
h. Vital signs with documented times
i. Patient assessment and interventions along with the timing of any medication or
intervention and the patient’s response to such interventions
5. The verbal or abbreviated written run report provided at the time of transfer of care does not
take the place of or negate the requirement for the provision of a complete electronic or
written medical record of the care provided by EMS personnel
Patient Safety Considerations
1. Routine use of lights and sirens is not warranted
2. Even when lights and sirens are in use, always limit speeds to level that is safe for the
emergency vehicle being driven and road conditions on which it is being operated
3. Be aware of legal issues and patient rights as they pertain to and impact patient care (e.g.,
patients with functional needs or children with special healthcare needs)
4. Be aware of potential need to adjust management based on patient age and comorbidities,
including medication dosages
5. The maximum weight-based dose of medication administered to a pediatric patient should not
exceed the maximum adult dose except where specifically stated in a patient care guideline
6. Medical direction should be contacted when mandated or as needed
7. Consider air medical transport, if available, for patients with time-critical conditions where
ground transport time exceeds 30 minutes
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. Pediatrics: use a weight-based assessment tool (length-based tape or other system) to estimate
patient weight and guide medication therapy and adjunct choice
a. Although the defined age varies by state, the pediatric population is generally defined by
those patients who weigh up to 40 kg or up to 14 years of age, whichever comes first
b. Consider using the pediatric assessment triangle (appearance, work of breathing,
circulation) when first approaching a child to help with assessment
2. Geriatrics: although the defined age varies by state, the geriatric population is generally defined
as those patients who are 65 years old or more
a. In these patients, as well as all adult patients, reduced medication dosages may apply to
patients with renal disease (i.e., on dialysis or a diagnosis of chronic renal insufficiency) or
hepatic disease (i.e., severe cirrhosis or end-stage liver disease)

Version 3.0

3. Co-morbidities: reduced medication dosages may apply to patients with renal disease (i.e., on
dialysis or a diagnosis of chronic renal insufficiency) or hepatic disease (i.e., severe cirrhosis or
end-stage liver disease)
4. Vital Signs:
a. Oxygen
i. Administer oxygen as appropriate with a target of achieving 94–98% saturation
ii. Supplemental oxygen administration is warranted to patients with oxygen saturations
below this level and titrated based upon clinical condition, clinical response, and
geographic location and altitude
iii. The method of oxygen delivery should minimize or treat hypercarbia associated with
hypoventilation (e.g., non-invasive positive airway pressure devices)
b. Normal vital signs (See Table 1. Normal Vital Signs)
i. Hypotension is considered a systolic blood pressure less than the lower limit on the
chart
ii. Tachycardia is considered a pulse above the upper limit on the chart
iii. Bradycardia is considered a pulse below the lower limit on the chart
iv. Tachypnea is considered a respiratory rate above the upper limit on the chart
v. Bradypnea is considered a respiratory rate below the lower limit on the chart
c. Hypertension. Although abnormal, may be an expected finding in many patients
i. Unless an intervention is specifically suggested based on the patient’s complaint or
presentation, the hypertension should be documented, but otherwise, no intervention
should be taken acutely to normalize the blood pressure
ii. The occurrence of symptoms (e.g., chest pain, dyspnea, vision change, headache, focal
weakness or change in sensation, altered mental status) in patients with hypertension
should be considered concerning, and care should be provided appropriate with the
patient’s complaint or presentation
5. Secondary Survey: if patient has critical primary survey problems, it may not be possible to
complete
6. Critical Patients: proactive patient management should occur simultaneously with assessment
a. Ideally, one clinician should be assigned to exclusively monitor and facilitate patientfocused care
b. Other than lifesaving interventions that prevent deterioration en route, treatment and
Interventions should be initiated as soon as practical, but should not impede extrication or
delay transport to definitive care
7. Air Medical Transport: air transport of trauma patients should generally be reserved for higher
acuity trauma patients where there is a significant time saved over ground transport, where the
appropriate destination is not accessible by ground due to systemic or logistical issues, and for
patients who meet the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (ACS-COT) 2022
National Guideline for the Field Triage of Injured Patients anatomic, physiologic, and situational
high-acuity triage criteria. In selected circumstances, air medical resources may be helpful for
non-trauma care (e.g., stroke, STEMI when geographically constrained)
8. Additional Protective Measures for the EMS Clinician: Due to suspected or confirmed hazards
and/or highly infectious contagious diseases, traditional patient treatment and care delivery
may be altered due to recommendations by federal, state, local or jurisdictional officials

for respiratory rate and heart rate in the appendix of the article by Fleming, et al, published in Lancet
Note: While many factors affect blood pressure (e.g., pain, activity, hydration), it is imperative to
rapidly recognize hypotension, especially in children. For children of the ages 1–10, hypotension is
present if the systolic blood pressure is less than 70 mmHg + (child’s age in years x 2) mmHg.

degree of disability. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, this includes,
but is not limited to, individuals with physical, sensory, mental health, and cognitive and/or
intellectual disabilities affecting their ability to function independently without assistance
Exclusion Criteria
None noted
Patient Management
Assessment
1. Identify the functional need by means of information from the patient, the patient’s family,
bystanders, medic alert bracelets or documents, or the patient’s adjunct assistance devices
2. The physical examination should not be intentionally abbreviated, although the way the exam is
performed may need to be modified to accommodate the specific needs of the patient
Treatment and Interventions
Medical care should not intentionally be reduced or abbreviated during the triage, treatment, and
transport of patients with functional needs, although the way the care is provided may need to be
modified to accommodate the specific needs of the patient
Patient Safety Considerations
For patients with communication barriers (language or sensory), it may be desirable to obtain
secondary confirmation of pertinent data (e.g., allergies) from the patient’s family, interpreters, or
written or electronic medical records. The family members can be an excellent source of
information and the presence of a family member can have a calming influence on some of these
patients

wheelchair, or fetching dropped items”
a. Services animals are not classified as a pet and should, by law, always be permitted to
accompany the patient with the following exceptions:
i. A public entity may ask an individual with a disability to remove a service animal from
the premises if:
1. The animal is out of control and the animal's handler does not take effective action
to control it; or
2. The animal is not housebroken
b. Service animals are not required to wear a vest or a leash. It is illegal to make a request for
special identification or documentation from the service animal’s partner. EMS clinicians
may only ask the patient if the service animal is required because of a disability and the
form of assistance the animal has been trained to perform.
c. EMS clinicians are not responsible for the care of the service animal. If the patient is
incapacitated and cannot personally care for the service animal, a decision can be made
whether to transport the animal in this situation.
d. Animals that solely provide emotional support, comfort, or companionship do not qualify as
service animals

Patient Refusals
Aliases
Against medical advice

Refusal of treatment

Refusal of transport

Patient Care Goals/Patient Presentation (Overview)
If an individual (or the parent or legal guardian of the individual) refuses secondary care and/or ambulance
transport to a hospital after prehospital clinicians have been called to the scene, clinicians should determine
the patient’s capacity to make decisions. Competency is generally a legal status of a person’s ability to make
decisions. However, state laws vary in the definition of competency and its impact upon authority.
Therefore, one should consult with the respective state EMS office for clarification on legal definitions and
patient rights.
Patient Management
Assessment
1. Decision-Making Capacity
a. An individual who is alert, oriented, and can understand the circumstances surrounding
his/her illness or impairment, as well as the possible risks associated with refusing
treatment and/or transport, typically is considered to have decision-making capacity
b. The individual’s judgment must also not be significantly impaired by illness, injury, or
drugs/alcohol intoxication. Individuals who have attempted suicide, verbalized suicidal
intent, or had other factors that lead EMS clinicians to suspect suicidal intent, should not be
regarded as having decision-making capacity and may not decline transport to a medical
facility
Treatment and Interventions
1. Obtain a complete set of vital signs and complete an initial assessment, paying particular
attention to the individual’s neurologic and mental status
2. Determine the individual’s capacity to make a valid judgment concerning the extent of his/her
illness or injury; if the EMS clinician has doubts about whether the individual has the mental
capacity to refuse or if the patient lacks capacity, the EMS clinician should contact medical
direction
3. If patient has capacity, clearly explain to the individual and all responsible parties the possible
risks and overall concerns with regards to refusing care and that they may reengage the EMS
system if needed
4. Perform appropriate medical care with the consent of the individual
5. Complete the patient care report clearly documenting the initial assessment findings and the
discussions with all involved individuals regarding the possible consequences of refusing
additional prehospital care and/or transportation
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. An adult or emancipated minor who has demonstrated possessing sufficient mental capacity for
making decisions has the right to determine the course of his/her medical care, including the
refusal of care
________________________

Universal Care
Patient Refusals

Go To TOC

Rev. March 2022
23

NASEMSO
National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines

Version 3.0

2. Individuals must be advised of the risks and consequences resulting from refusal of medical care
to enable an informed decision regarding consent or refusal of treatment
3. An individual determined to lack decision-making capacity by EMS clinicians should not be
allowed to refuse care against medical advice or to be released at the scene. Mental illness,
drugs, alcohol intoxication, or physical/mental impairment may significantly impair an
individual’s decision-making capacity. Individuals who have attempted suicide, verbalized
suicidal intent, or had other factors that lead EMS clinicians to suspect suicidal intent, should
not be regarded as having demonstrated sufficient decision-making capacity
4. The determination of decision-making capacity may be challenged by communication barriers
or cultural differences
5. EMS clinicians should not put themselves in danger by attempting to treat and/or transport an
individual who refuses care. Law enforcement personnel should be requested if needed
6. Always act in the best interest of the patient. EMS clinicians, with the support of direct medical
oversight, must strike a balance between abandoning the patient and forcing care
7. Special Considerations – Minors
It is preferable for minors to have a parent or legal guardian who can provide consent for
treatment on behalf of the child
a. All states allow healthcare clinicians to provide emergency treatment when a parent is not
available to provide consent. This is known as the emergency exception rule or the doctrine
of implied consent. For minors, this doctrine means that the EMS clinician can presume
consent and proceed with appropriate treatment and transport if the following six
conditions are met:
i. The child is suffering from an emergent condition that places their life or health in
danger
ii. The child’s legal guardian is unavailable or unable to provide consent for treatment or
transport
iii. Treatment or transport cannot be safely delayed until consent can be obtained
iv. The EMS clinician administers only treatment for emergency conditions that pose an
immediate threat to the child
v. As a rule, when the EMS clinician’s authority to act is in doubt, EMS clinicians should
always do what they believe to be in the best interest of the minor
vi. If a minor is injured or ill and no parent contact is possible, the EMS clinician may
contact medical direction for additional instructions

Adult and Pediatric Syncope and Near Syncope
Aliases
Loss of consciousness
Patient Care Goals
1. Stabilize and resuscitate when necessary
2. Initiate monitoring and diagnostic procedures
3. Transfer for further evaluation
Patient Presentation
1. Syncope is heralded by both the loss of consciousness and the loss of postural tone and resolves
spontaneously without medical interventions. Syncope typically is abrupt in onset and resolves
equally quickly. EMS clinicians may find the patient awake and alert on initial evaluation
2. Near syncope is defined as the prodromal symptoms of syncope. The symptoms that can
precede syncope last for seconds to minutes with signs and symptoms that may include pallor,
sweating, lightheadedness, visual changes, or weakness. It may be described by the patient as
“nearly blacking out” or “nearly fainting”.
3. Rapid first aid during the onset may improve symptoms and prevent syncope
Inclusion Criteria
1. Abrupt loss of consciousness with loss of postural tone
2. Prodromal symptoms of syncope
Exclusion Criteria
Conditions other than the above, including:
1. Patients with alternate and obvious cause of loss of consciousness (e.g., trauma – See Head
Injury Guideline)
2. Patients with ongoing mental status changes or coma should be treated per the Altered Mental
Status Guideline
3. Patients with persistent new neurologic deficit [See Suspected Stroke/Transient Ischemic Attack
Guideline]
Patient Management
Assessment
1. Pertinent History
a. Review the patient’s past medical history including a history of:
i. Cardiovascular disease (e.g., cardiac disease/stroke, valvular disease, hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy, mitral valve prolapse)
ii. Seizure
iii. Recent trauma
iv. Active cancer diagnosis

Version 3.0

Patient Safety Considerations:
1. Patients suffering from syncope due to arrhythmia may experience recurrent arrhythmias and
should therefore be placed on a cardiac monitor
2. Geriatric patients suffering falls from standing may sustain significant injury and should be
diligently screened for trauma. [General Trauma Management Guideline]
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. By being most proximate to the scene and to the patient’s presentation, EMS clinicians are
commonly in a unique position to identify the cause of syncope. Consideration of potential
causes, ongoing monitoring of vitals and cardiac rhythm and detailed exam and history are
essential pieces of information to pass on to hospital clinicians
2. For patients where a lower risk etiology is suspected, e.g., vasovagal syncope, decisions
regarding delayed or non-transport should be made in consultation with medical direction
3. High-risk causes of syncope include, but are not limited to, the following:
a. Cardiovascular
i. Myocardial infarction
ii. Aortic stenosis
iii. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (consider in young patient with unexplained syncope
during exertion)
iv. Pulmonary embolus
v. Aortic dissection
vi. Dysrhythmia
vii. Mitral valve prolapse is associated with higher risk for sudden death
b. Neurovascular
i. Intracranial hemorrhage
ii. Transient ischemic attack or stroke
iii. Vertebral basilar insufficiency
c. Hemorrhagic
i. Ruptured ectopic pregnancy
ii. GI bleed
iii. Aortic rupture
4. Consider high-risk 12-lead EKG features including, but not limited to:
a. Evidence of QT prolongation (generally over 500 msec)
b. Delta waves
c. Brugada syndrome (incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB) pattern in V1/V2 with ST
segment elevation)
d. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy
Pertinent Assessment Findings
1. 12-lead EKG findings
2. Evidence of alternate etiology, including seizure
3. Evidence of cardiac dysfunction (e.g., evidence of congestive heart failure (CHF), arrhythmia)
4. Evidence of hemorrhage
5. Evidence of neurologic compromise

Chest Pain/Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)/ST-segment Elevation Myocardial
Infarction (STEMI)
Aliases
Heart attack

Myocardial infarction (MI)

Patient Care Goals
1. Identify ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) quickly
2. Determine the time of symptom onset
3. Activate hospital-based STEMI system of care
4. Monitor vital signs and cardiac rhythm and be prepared to provide CPR and defibrillation if
needed
5. Administer appropriate medications
6. Transport to appropriate facility
Patient Presentation
Inclusion Criteria
1. Chest pain or discomfort in other areas of the body (e.g., arm, jaw, epigastrium) of suspected
cardiac origin, shortness of breath, associated or unexplained sweating, nausea, vomiting, or
dizziness. Atypical or unusual symptoms are more common in women, the elderly, and diabetic
patients. May also present with CHF, syncope, and/or shock
2. Chest pain associated sympathomimetic use (e.g., cocaine, methamphetamine)
3. Some patients will present with likely non-cardiac chest pain and otherwise have a low
likelihood of ACS (e.g., blunt trauma to the chest of a child). For these patients, defer the
administration of aspirin (ASA) and nitrates per the Pain Management Guideline
Exclusion Criteria
None noted
Patient Management
Assessment, Treatment, and Interventions
1. Signs and symptoms include chest pain, congestive heart failure (CHF), syncope, shock,
symptoms similar to a patient’s previous MI
2. Assess the patient’s cardiac rhythm and immediately address pulseless rhythms,
symptomatic tachycardia, or symptomatic bradycardia [See Cardiovascular
Section and Resuscitation Section]
3. If the patient is dyspneic, hypoxemic, or has obvious signs of heart failure, EMS clinicians
should administer oxygen as appropriate with a target of achieving 94–98% saturation
[Refer to Universal Care Guideline]
4. The 12-lead EKG is the primary diagnostic tool that identifies a STEMI; it is imperative that
EMS clinicians routinely acquire a 12-lead EKG within 10 minutes for all patients exhibiting
signs and symptoms of ACS

Version 3.0

a. The EKG may be transmitted for remote interpretation by a physician or screened for
STEMI by properly trained EMS clinicians or other healthcare providers with or without
the assistance of computer-interpretation
b. Advance notification should be provided to the receiving hospital for patients identified as
having a STEMI
c. Performance of serial EKGs is encouraged for symptomatic patients with EKGs initially nondiagnostic for STEMI
d. All EKGs should be made available to treating personnel at the receiving hospital, whether
hand delivered as hard copy or transmitted from the field
5. Administer aspirin; chewable, non-enteric-coated aspirin preferred (162–325 mg)
6. Establish IV access
7. Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual (SL), can repeat q (quaque, every) 3–5 minutes if SBP greater
than 100 mmHg
a. The use of nitrates should be avoided in any patient who has used a phosphodiesterase
inhibitor within the past 48 hours
b. Examples include sildenafil (Viagra®, Revatio®), vardenafil (Levitra®, Staxyn®), tadalafil
(Cialis®, Adcirca®) which are used for erectile dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension.
Also avoid use in patients receiving intravenous epoprostenol (Flolan®)
or treporstenil (Remodulin®) which is used for pulmonary hypertension
c. Care should always be taken when giving nitroglycerin when the patient’s blood pressure
is marginal. If used in this setting, the clinician should weigh the risk and benefit of nitrate
administration over the administration of an opiate analgesic and be ready to respond to
hypotension with fluid bolus or pressor
8. The location of the infarct does not preclude the use of nitrates. Right-sided leads are of no
additional value if an inferior STEMI has been diagnosed and such findings (presumed RV
infarct) do not preclude the use of nitroglycerin: however, continually monitor the patient’s
hemodynamic status and be prepared to resuscitate if hypotension occurs
9. If the pain is unresponsive to nitrates, opiates are an acceptable alternative. Morphine should
be used with caution in unstable angina (UA)/non-STEMI due to an association with increased
mortality
10. Transport and destination decisions should be based on local resources and system of care
11. Early notification to receiving facility of any changes in patient condition or serial EKGs
Patient Safety Considerations
1. Observe for signs of clinical deterioration: dysrhythmias, chest pain, shortness of breath,
decreased level of consciousness/syncope, or other signs of shock/hypotension
2. Perform serial 12-lead EKGs (especially if clinical changes are noted)
3. Consider placing defibrillator pads on high-risk patients
4. Consider configuring monitor/defibrillator to allow automatic VT/VF alert
5. Consider configuring monitor/defibrillator to allow ST-segment trending if available
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
Acute coronary syndrome may present with atypical pain, vague or only generalized complaints.

Ischemic burden time is a risk for morbidity and mortality, EMS can help decrease first medical
contact to intervention time/reflow by efficient scripting/training of safely minimizing scene time
Pertinent Assessment Findings
A complete medication list should be obtained from each patient. It is especially important for the
treating physician and healthcare providers to be informed if the patient is taking beta-blockers,
calcium channel blockers, clonidine, digoxin, blood thinners (anticoagulants), and medications for
the treatment of erectile dysfunction or pulmonary hypertension

f.

Consider the following additional therapies if bradycardia and symptoms or hemodynamic
instability continue:
i. Atropine 1 mg IV q 3–5 minutes (maximum total dose of 3 mg)
ii. Vasopressor medications (in order of preference)
1. Epinephrine IV drip 0.02–0.2 mcg/kg/min titrated to a MAP greater than 65 mmHg
OR
2. Epinephrine by push dose (dilute boluses): for example, prepare 10 mcg/mL by
adding 1 mL of 0.1 mg/mL epinephrine to 9 mL of normal saline, then administer
10–20 mcg boluses (1–2 mL) q 2 minutes titrated MAP greater than 65 mmHg
OR
3. Norepinephrine 0.02–0.4 mcg/kg/minute IV titrated to a MAP greater than 65
mmHg
iii. Transcutaneous Pacing – If pacing is performed, consider sedation or pain control
2. Pediatric Management
Treatment is only indicated for patients who are symptomatic (pale/cyanotic, diaphoretic,
altered mental status, hypoxic)
a. For infants and newborns, initiate chest compressions for heart rate less than 60 BPM and
signs of poor perfusion (altered mental status, hypoxia, hypotension, weak pulse, delayed
capillary refill, cyanosis)
b. Manage airway and assist ventilations as necessary with minimally interrupted chest
compressions using a compression-to-ventilation ratio 15:2 (30:2 if single clinician is
present)
c. Administer oxygen as appropriate with a target of achieving 94–98% saturation
d. Initiate monitoring and perform 12-lead EKG
e. Establish IV access
f. Check blood glucose and treat hypoglycemia per the Hypoglycemia Guideline
g. Consider the following additional therapies if bradycardia and symptoms or hemodynamic
instability continue:
i. Epinephrine by push dose (dilute boluses). For example, prepare 10 mcg/mL by adding
1 mL of 0.1 mg/mL epinephrine to 9 mL of normal saline, then administer 0.01 mg/kg
(0.1 mL/kg) maximum single dose 10 mcg (1 mL) q 3–5 minutes titrated to MAP greater
than 65 mmHg
ii. Also consider atropine 0.01–0.02 mg/kg IV with minimum dose of 0.1 mg if increased
vagal tone or cholinergic drug toxicity to maximum initial dose of 0.5 mg (maximum
total dose of 3 mg)
iii. Transcutaneous pacing: If pacing is performed, consider sedation or pain control
iv. Epinephrine may be used for bradycardia and poor perfusion unresponsive to
ventilation and oxygenation
1. It is reasonable to administer atropine for bradycardia caused by increased vagal
tone or cholinergic drug toxicity
Patient Safety Considerations
If pacing is performed, consider sedation or pain control

Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. Observe for signs of decreased end-organ perfusion: chest pain (CP), shortness of breath (SOB),
decreased level of consciousness, syncope, or other signs of shock/hypotension
2. Patients who have undergone cardiac transplant will not respond to atropine
3. Consider potential culprit medications including beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers,
sodium channel blockers/anti-depressants, digoxin, and clonidine
a. If medication overdose is considered, refer to appropriate guideline in the Toxins and
Environmental Section
4. The differential diagnosis includes the following: myocardial infarction (MI), hypoxia, pacemaker
failure, hypothermia, sinus bradycardia, athletes, head injury with increased intracranial
pressure (ICP), stroke, spinal cord lesion, sick sinus syndrome, AV blocks, overdose, cholinergic
nerve agents
5. Consider hyperkalemia in the patient with wide complex bradycardia
6. Bradycardia should be managed via the least invasive manner possible, escalating care as
needed
a. Third-degree heart block or the denervated heart (as in cardiac transplant) may not respond
to atropine and in these cases, proceed quickly to chronotropic agents (such as epinephrine
or dopamine) or transcutaneous pacing
b. Dopamine is not indicated for pediatric patients
c. In cases of impending hemodynamic collapse, proceed directly to transcutaneous pacing
d. For shock that is suspected to be from sepsis, norepinephrine is preferred over dopamine
due to its reduced risk of arrhythmias and its lower mortality rate
7. Be aware of acute coronary syndrome as a cause of bradycardia in adult patients
8. When dosing medications for pediatric patients, dose should be weight-based for non-obese
patients and based on ideal body weight for obese patients
9. Although dopamine is often recommended for the treatment of symptomatic bradycardia,
recent research suggests that patients in cardiogenic or septic shock treated with
norepinephrine have a lower mortality rate compared to those treated with dopamine
10. Caution: Norepinephrine can theoretically cause reflex bradycardia

5. If patient is experiencing VAD-related complications or cardiovascular problems, expedite
transport to the medical facility where VAD was placed if patient’s clinical condition and time
allows
6. If patient has a functioning VAD and is experiencing a non-cardiovascular-related problem,
transport to a facility that is appropriate for the patient’s main presenting problem without
manipulating the device
7. If patient has a functioning VAD and is hypoperfused:
a. Administer IV fluids (30 mL/kg isotonic fluid; maximum of 1 liter) over less than 15 minutes,
using a push-pull method of drawing up the fluid in a syringe and pushing it through the IV
b. May repeat up to 3 times based on patient’s condition and clinical impression for a total
cumulative dose not to exceed 3 L
8. If patient is in full cardiac arrest:
a. CPR should not be performed if there is any evidence the pump is still functioning. The
decision whether to perform CPR should be made based upon best clinical judgment in
consultation with the patient’s VAD-trained companion and the VAD coordinator (or direct
medical oversight if VAD coordinator unavailable)
b. CPR may be initiated only where:
i. You have confirmed the pump has stopped and troubleshooting efforts to restart it
have failed, and
ii. The patient is unresponsive and has no detectable signs of life
Notes/Educational Pearls
1. You do not need to disconnect the controller or batteries to:
a. Defibrillate or cardiovert
b. Acquire a 12-lead EKG
2. Automatic non-invasive cuff blood pressures may be difficult to obtain due to the narrow pulse
pressure created by the continuous flow pump
3. Flow though many VAD devices is not pulsatile, and patients may not have a palpable pulse or
accurate pulse oximetry
4. The blood pressure, if measurable, may not be an accurate measure of perfusion
5. Ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, or asystole/PEA may be the patient’s “normal”
underlying rhythm. Evaluate clinical condition and provide care in consultation with VAD
coordinator
6. The patient’s travel bag should always accompany them with back-up controller and spare
batteries
7. If feasible, bring the patient’s power module, cable, and display module to the hospital
8. All patients should carry a spare pump controller with them
9. The most common cause for VAD alarms is low batteries or battery failures
10. Although automatic non-invasive blood pressure cuffs are often ineffective in measuring
systolic and diastolic pressure, if they do obtain a measurement, the MAP is usually accurate
11. Other VAD complications:
a. Infection
b. Stroke/Transient ischemic attack (TIA)
c. Bleeding
d. Arrhythmias
e. Cardiac tamponade

2. A-FIB rarely requires cardioversion in the field. As it is difficult to ascertain the onset of this
rhythm, the risk of stroke needs to be considered prior to cardioversion
3. A wide-complex irregular rhythm should be considered pre-excited A-FIB; extreme care must be
taken in these patients
a. Characteristic EKG findings include a short PR interval and, in some cases, a delta wave
b. Avoid AV nodal blocking agents such as adenosine, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, and
possibly beta-blockers in patients with pre-excitation A-FIB (e.g., Wolff-Parkinson-White
Syndrome, Lown-Ganong-Levine Syndrome) because these drugs may cause a paradoxical
increase in the ventricular response
c. Blocking the AV node in some of these patients may lead to impulses that are transmitted
exclusively down the accessory pathway, which can result in ventricular fibrillation
d. Amiodarone or procainamide may be used as an alternative
4. Amiodarone or procainamide can be used as a rate-controlling agent for patients who are
intolerant of or unresponsive to other agents, such as patients with CHF who may not otherwise
tolerate diltiazem or metoprolol
a. Caution should be exercised in those who are not receiving anticoagulation, as amiodarone
can promote cardioversion
5. Administer metoprolol to patients with SBP greater than 120 mmHg
a. Worsening CHF, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, as well as
hypotension and bradycardia can occur with use of metoprolol
6. Biphasic waveforms have been proven to convert A-FIB at lower energies and higher rates of
success than monophasic waveforms
a. Strategies include dose escalation (70, 120, 150, 170 joules (J) for biphasic or 100, 200, 300,
360 J for monophasic) versus beginning with single high energy/highest success rate for
single shock delivered
7. Studies in infants and children have demonstrated the effectiveness of adenosine for the
treatment of hemodynamically stable or unstable SVT
8. Adenosine should be considered the preferred medication for stable SVT
a. Verapamil may be considered as alternative therapy in older children but should not be
routinely used in infants
b. Procainamide or amiodarone given by a slow IV infusion with careful hemodynamic
monitoring may be considered for refractory SVT
Pertinent Assessment Findings
None noted
Patient Safety Considerations
1. Only use one antidysrhythmic at a time
2. Patients who receive beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) with calcium channel blockers (e.g.,
diltiazem) are at increased risk for hypotension and bradycardia
3. If using cardioversion, consider sedation and pain control
4. With irregular wide complex tachycardia (A-FIB with aberrancy such as Wolff-Parkinson-White
and Lown-Ganong Levine), avoid use of AV nodal blocking agents (e.g., adenosine, calcium
channel blockers, beta-blockers)
5. Patients with Wolff–Parkinson–White should be given procainamide prior to amiodarone

Abuse and Maltreatment
Aliases
Maltreatment of vulnerable populations

Non-accidental trauma

Definitions
1. Abuse/Maltreatment: Any act or series of acts of commission or omission by a caregiver or
person in a position of power over the patient that results in harm, potential for harm, or
threat of harm to a patient of any age group. EMS clinicians should have a heightened
awareness for vulnerable populations which include, but is not limited to, children, elderly,
and adults with mental or physical disabilities
2. Child Abuse/Maltreatment: Child maltreatment includes any act or series of acts of
commission or omission by a parent or other caregiver that results in harm, potential for
harm, or threat of harm to a child. An act of commission (child abuse) is the physical, sexual,
or emotional maltreatment or neglect of a child or children. An act of omission (child neglect)
includes, but is not limited to, failure to provide for the child’s needs (e.g., physical, emotional,
medical/dental, and educational neglect) and failure to supervise (e.g., inadequate supervision
or safety precautions, lack of appropriate car seat use, and exposure to violent or dangerous
environments)
3. Human Trafficking: when people are abducted or coerced into service (e.g., being forced into
servitude without compensation and/or prostitution). Signs may include, but are not limited
to, patient with branding/tattoos and environmental clues such as padlocks and/or doorknobs
removed on interior doors and intact windows that are boarded up
Patient Care Goals
1. Recognize any act or series of acts of commission or omission by a caregiver or person in a
position of power over the patient that results in harm, potential for harm, or threat of harm to
a patient
2. Take appropriate steps to protect the safety of the responders as well as bystanders
3. Remove the patient from immediate danger
4. Assess any patient injuries that may be the result of acute or chronic events
5. Attempt to preserve evidence whenever possible; however, the overriding concern should be
providing appropriate emergency care to the patient
6. Complete all mandatory reporting requirements per state guidelines
Patient Presentation
1. Clues to abuse or maltreatment can vary with age group of the patient and type of abuse
2. Not all abuse or maltreatment is physical
3. EMS role is to:
a. Document concerns
b. Assess potentially serious injuries
c. Disclose concerns to appropriate authorities
d. Initiate help to get the patient and any other vulnerable individuals at the scene into a safe
situation
e. Not to investigate or intervene beyond the steps above
f. Leave further intervention to law enforcement personnel

Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
Absolute inclusion/exclusion criteria are not possible in this area. Rather, clues consistent with
different types of abuse/maltreatment should be sought:
1. Potential clues to abuse/maltreatment from caregivers or general environment:
a. Caregiver apathy about patient’s current situation
b. Caregiver overreaction to questions about situation
c. Inconsistent histories from caregivers or bystanders regarding what happened
d. Information provided by caregivers or patient that is not consistent with injury patterns
e. Injuries not appropriate for patient’s age or physical abilities (e.g., infants with injuries
usually associated with ambulatory children, elders who have limited mobility with
injury mechanisms inconsistent with their capabilities)
f. Caregiver not allowing adult patient to speak for themself, or who appears controlling –
pay special attention to patients who cannot communicate due to young age or language
and/or cultural barriers
g. Inadequate safety precautions or facilities where the patient lives and/or evidence of
security measures that appear to confine the patient inappropriately
2. Potential clues to abuse or maltreatment that can be obtained from the patient:
a. Multiple bruises in various stages of healing
b. Age-inappropriate behavior (e.g., adults who are submissive or fearful, children who act
in a sexually inappropriate way)
c. Pattern burns, bruises, or scars suggestive of specific weaponry used
d. Evidence of medical neglect for injuries or infections
e. Unexplained trauma to genitourinary systems or frequent infections to this system
f. Evidence of malnourishment and/or serious dental problems
3. Have a high index of suspicion for abuse in children presenting with a Brief Resolved
Unexplained Event (BRUE) [See Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) & Acute
Events in Infants Guideline]
Patient Management
Assessment
1. Primary survey and identify any potentially life-threatening issues
2. Document thorough secondary survey to identify clues of for potential abuse/maltreatment:
a. Multiple bruises in various stages of healing. A complete skin exam can help identify

Version 3.0

Treatment and Interventions
1. Address life-threatening issues
2. Remove the patient to a safe place even if no medical indication for transport
3. Report concerns about potential abuse/maltreatment to law enforcement immediately, in
accordance with state law, including:
a. Caregivers impeding your ability to assess/transport patient
b. Caregivers refusing care for the patient
4. For patients transported, report concerns to hospital and/or law enforcement personnel
(including Child Protective Services agencies where appropriate) per mandatory reporting laws
Patient Safety Considerations
1. If no medical emergency exists, the next priority is safe patient disposition/removal from the
potentially abusive situation
2. Do not confront suspected perpetrators of abuse/maltreatment. This can create an unsafe
situation for EMS and for the patient
3. In situations of parental or religious objections to life-saving medical care when EMS
suspects abuse, law enforcement should be notified for assistance
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. All states have specific mandatory reporting laws that dictate which specific crimes such as
suspected abuse or maltreatment must be reported and to whom they must be reported. It is
important to be familiar with the specific laws in your state including specifically who must
make disclosures, what the thresholds are for disclosures, and to whom the disclosures must
be made
2. Clues to abuse or maltreatment can vary depending on the age group of the patient and on
the nature of the abuse. Remember that not all abuse or maltreatment involves physical
harm. EMS clinicians are often unique in being the only members of the medical team to
observe the home environment or injury scene. It is important to realize that the job of EMS is
to document their concerns, assess the patient for potentially serious injuries, make sure that
their concerns are disclosed to the appropriate legal authorities, and work towards getting the
patient into a safe situation. EMS personnel should not take it upon themselves to investigate,
interview, or intervene above and beyond those concepts and should leave further
intervention to the appropriate law enforcement personnel
3. Abuse and maltreatment can happen to patients of all ages
4. Patients may be unwilling or unable to disclose abuse or maltreatment, so the responsibility
falls on EMS personnel to assess the situation, document appropriately, and take appropriate
action to secure a safe place for the patient
5. Document findings by describing what you see and not ascribing possible causes (e.g., “0.5inch round burn to back” as opposed to “burn consistent with cigarette burn”)

iv. Supplemental straps or sheets may be necessary to prevent flexion/extension of torso,
hips, legs by being placed around the lower lumbar region, below the buttocks, and
over the thighs, knees, and legs
b. Extremities
i. Soft or leather devices should not require a key to release them
ii. Secure all four extremities to maximize safety for patient, staff, and others
iii. Secure all extremities to the stationary frame of the stretcher
iv. Multiple knots should not be used to secure a device
Patient Safety Considerations
The management of violent patients requires a constant reevaluation of the risk/benefit balance for
the patient and bystanders to provide the safest care for all involved. These are complex and highrisk encounters. There is no “one size fits all” solution for addressing these patients
1. Don PPE
2. Do not attempt to enter or control a scene where physical violence or weapons are present
3. Dispatch law enforcement immediately to secure and maintain scene safety
4. Urgent de-escalation of patient agitation is imperative in the interest of patient safety as well as
for EMS personnel and others on scene
5. Uncontrolled or poorly controlled patient agitation and physical violence can place the patient
at risk for sudden cardiopulmonary arrest due to the following etiologies:
a. Delirium with agitated behavior: A postmortem diagnosis of exclusion for sudden death
thought to result from metabolic acidosis (most likely from lactate) stemming from physical
agitation or physical control measures and potentially exacerbated by stimulant drugs (e.g.,
cocaine) or alcohol withdrawal
b. Positional asphyxia: Sudden death from restriction of chest wall movement and/or
obstruction of the airway secondary to restricted head or neck positioning resulting in
hypercarbia and/or hypoxia
6. Apply a cardiac monitor as soon as possible, particularly when pharmacologic management
medications have been administered
7. All patients who have received pharmacologic management medications must be monitored
closely for the development of hypoventilation and oversedation
a. Utilize capnography if available
8. Patients who have received antipsychotic medication for pharmacologic management must be
monitored closely for the potential development of:
a. Dystonic reactions (this can easily be treated with diphenhydramine/benzodiazepines)
b. Mydriasis (dilated pupils)
c. Ataxia
d. Cessation of perspiration
e. Dry mucous membranes
f. Cardiac arrhythmias (particularly QT prolongation)
9. Patients who require physical management should also receive pharmacological treatment for
agitation to prevent consequences of delirium with agitated behavior
10. Placement of stretcher in sitting position prevents aspiration and reduces the patient’s physical
strength by placing the abdominal muscles in the flexed position
11. Patients who are more physically uncooperative should be physically secured with one arm
above the head and the other arm below the waist, and both lower extremities individually
secured

12. The following techniques should be expressly prohibited for use by EMS clinicians:
a. Secure or transport in a prone position with or without hands and feet behind the back
(hobbling or “hog-tying”)
b. "Sandwiching” patients between backboards
c. Techniques that constrict the neck or compromise the airway
13. Concurrent use of IM/IV benzodiazepines and olanzapine IM is not recommended as fatalities
have been reported
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key considerations
1. Direct medical direction should be contacted at any time for advice, especially when patient’s
level of agitation is such that transport may place all parties at risk
2. Transport by air is not advised
3. Stretchers with adequate foam padding, particularly around the head, facilitates patient’s
ability to self-position the head and neck to maintain airway patency
4. For patients with key-locking devices, applied by another agency, consider the following
options:
a. Remove device and replace it with a device that does not require a key
b. Administer pharmacologic management medication then remove and replace device with
another non-key-locking device after patient has become more cooperative
c. Transport patient accompanied in patient compartment by person who has device key
d. Transport patient in the vehicle of person who has the device key if medical condition of
patient is deemed stable, direct medical direction so authorizes, and law allows
Pertinent Assessment Findings
1. Continuous monitoring of:
a. Airway patency
b. Respiratory status with pulse oximetry and/or capnography
c. Circulatory status with frequent blood pressure measurements
d. Mental status and trends in level of patient cooperation
e. Cardiac status, especially if the patient has received pharmacologic management
medication
f. Extremity perfusion with capillary refill in patients in physical management device

Patient Care Goals
1. Provide timely therapy for potentially life-threatening reactions to known or suspected
allergens to prevent cardiorespiratory collapse and shock
2. Provide symptomatic relief for symptoms due to known or suspected allergens
Patient Presentation
Inclusion Criteria

Exclusion Criteria
None noted
Patient Management
Assessment
1. Evaluate for patent airway and presence of oropharyngeal edema
2. Auscultate for wheezing and assess level of respiratory effort
3. Assess for adequacy of perfusion
4. Assess for presence of signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis
a. Anaphylaxis – More severe and is characterized by an acute onset involving:
i. The skin (urticaria) and/or mucosa with either respiratory compromise or decreased BP
or signs of end-organ dysfunction
OR
ii. Hypotension for that patient after exposure to a known allergen
1. Adults: Systolic BP less than 90
2. Pediatrics: See Appendix VIII. Abnormal Vital Signs

Version 3.0

Treatment and Interventions
1. If signs of allergic reaction without signs of anaphylaxis, go to Step 8
2. Epinephrine administration is the primary treatment for anaphylaxis. If signs of anaphylaxis,
administer epinephrine 1 mg/mL at the following dose and route:
a. Adult (25 kg or more) 0.3 mg IM in the anterolateral thigh
b. Pediatric (less than 25 kg) 0.15 mg in the anterolateral thigh
c. Epinephrine 1 mg/mL may be administered from a vial or via auto-injector, if available
3. If respiratory distress with wheezing is present, consider administering
a. Albuterol 2.5–5 mg nebulized
AND/OR
b. Epinephrine 1 mg/mL, 5 mL nebulized
4. If stridor is present, consider administering epinephrine 1 mg/mL, 5 mL nebulized
5. If signs of anaphylaxis and hypoperfusion persist following the first dose of epinephrine,
additional IM epinephrine can be repeated q5–15 minutes at above noted doses
6. For signs of hypoperfusion, also administer 20 mL/kg isotonic fluid (normal saline or lactated
Ringer’s) rapidly (over 15 minutes) via IV or IO, and repeat as needed for ongoing
hypoperfusion
7. Consider an epinephrine IV drip (0.5 mcg/kg/minute) when cardiovascular collapse
(hypotension with altered mental status, pallor, diaphoresis and/or delayed capillary refill) is
present despite repeated IM doses of epinephrine in conjunction with at least 60 mL/kg isotonic
fluid boluses
8. For urticaria or pruritus, administer a diphenhydramine 1 mg/kg, up to maximum dose of 50
mg IM, IV, or PO)
a. The IV route is preferred for the patient in severe symptoms
b. As a supplement to diphenhydramine given for urticaria, any H2-blocking antihistamine
(e.g., famotidine, cimetidine) can be given IV or PO in conjunction with diphenhydramine
9. Transport as soon as possible, and perform ongoing assessment as indicated. Cardiac monitoring
is not required, but should be considered for those with known heart problems or who received
multiple doses of epinephrine
Patient Safety Considerations
1. Time to epinephrine delivery
2. Concentration of epinephrine in relation to route
3. Weight-based dosing of medications
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. When anaphylaxis is suspected, EMS personnel should always consider epinephrine as firstline treatment
2. Allergic reactions and anaphylaxis are serious and potentially life-threatening medical
emergencies. It is the body’s adverse reaction to a foreign protein (e.g., food, medicine, pollen,
insect sting or any ingested, inhaled, or injected substance). A localized allergic reaction (e.g.,
urticaria or angioedema that does not compromise the airway) may be treated with
antihistamine therapy. Cardiovascular collapse may occur abruptly, without the prior
development of skin or respiratory symptoms. Constant monitoring of the patient’s airway and
breathing is essential

3. Contrary to common belief that all cases of anaphylaxis present with cutaneous manifestations,
such as urticaria or mucocutaneous swelling, a significant portion of anaphylactic episodes may
not involve these signs and symptoms on initial presentation. Moreover, most fatal reactions to
food-induced anaphylaxis in children were not associated with cutaneous manifestations
4. A thorough assessment and a high index of suspicion are required for all potential allergic
reaction patients – consider:
a. History of Present Illness
i. Onset and location
ii. Insect sting or bite
iii. Food allergy/exposure
iv. New clothing, soap, detergent
v. Past history of reactions
vi. Medication history
b. Signs and Symptoms
i. Itching or urticaria
ii. Coughing, wheezing, or respiratory distress
iii. Chest tightness or throat constriction
iv. Hypotension or shock
v. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea)
vi. Altered mental status (AMS)
c. Other Considerations
i. Angioedema (drug-induced)
ii. Aspiration/airway obstruction
iii. Vasovagal event
iv. Asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
v. Heart failure
5. Gastrointestinal symptoms occur most commonly in food-induced anaphylaxis, but can occur
with other causes
a. Oral pruritus is often the first symptom observed in patients experiencing food-induced
anaphylaxis
b. Abdominal cramping is also common, but nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are frequently
observed as well
6. Patients with asthma are at high-risk for a severe allergic reaction
7. There is no proven benefit to using steroids in the management of allergic reactions and/or
anaphylaxis
8. There is controversy among experts with very low-quality evidence to guide management for
the use of empiric IM epinephrine after exposure to a known allergen in asymptomatic patients
with a history of prior anaphylaxis
Pertinent Assessment Findings
1. Presence or absence of angioedema
2. Presence or absence of respiratory compromise
3. Presence or absence of circulatory compromise
4. Localized or generalized urticaria
5. Response to therapy

a. Provide volume expansion with normal saline bolus
i. Adult: Normal saline 20 mL/kg at rate of 1000 mL/hr; if symptoms of hypovolemic
shock, follow Shock Guideline.
ii. Pediatric: Normal saline 10 mL/kg bolus IV, reassess, and repeat up to 40 mL/kg
total; if symptoms of hypovolemic shock, follow Shock Guideline.
If findings of hyperkalemia are present, administer IV fluids and consider administration of:
a. Calcium chloride: 1 gm IV/IO over 5 minutes, ensure IV patency and do not exceed 1
mL per minute
OR
b. Calcium gluconate: 2 gm IV/IO over 5 minutes, with constant cardiac monitoring
If findings of hyperkalemia, consider administration of sodium bicarbonate 1 mEq/kg (max
dose of 50 mEq) IV bolus over 5 minutes and consider albuterol 5 mg via nebulizer (can be
repeated if no response is seen) to the two places in the document where the administration
of albuterol is suggested for the treatment of hyperkalemia
Reassess patient
a. Reassess vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, neurologic status assessment),
mental status, and signs of dehydration
b. If mental status changes, reassess blood glucose level and provide appropriate
treatment if hypoglycemia has developed
Disposition
a. Transport to closest appropriate receiving facility

Patient Safety Considerations
1. Overly aggressive administration of fluid in hyperglycemic patients may cause cerebral
edema or dangerous hyponatremia. Cerebral edema is a leading cause of death in
children with DKA but is very rare in adults
a. Closely monitor for signs of altered mental status, increased intracranial pressure, and
immediately discontinue IV fluids and elevate head of bed if signs of increased ICP
develop
b. Reassess and manage airway as needed
2. Asymptomatic hyperglycemia poses no risk to the patient while inappropriately aggressive
interventions to manage blood sugar may harm patients
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. New onset DKA in pediatric patients commonly presents with nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain, and/or urinary frequency
2. Consider causes for hyperglycemia by thinking about the 3 I’s:
a. Insulin: This refers to any medication changes for insulin or oral medications including
poor compliance or malfunctioning insulin pump
b. Ischemia: This refers to hyperglycemia sometimes being an indication of physiologic
stress in a patient and can be a clue to myocardial ischemia in particular
c. Infection: Underlying infection can cause derangements in glucose control
Pertinent Assessment Findings
1. Concomitant trauma
2. Abdominal pain, “fruity breath,” and rapid-deep respirations (Kussmaul respirations) may

i.

Glucose, oral (in form of glucose tablets, glucose gel, tube of cake icing, etc.)
1. Adult Dosing: 25 g
2. Pediatric Dosing: 0.5–1 g/kg
b. Unconscious patient, or patients who are unable to protect their own airway:
i. Dextrose IV – administer in incremental doses until mental status improves or
maximum field dosing is reached (if available, D10% is preferred)
1. Maximum field adult dosing: 25 g of 10–50% dextrose IV
a. 50 mL of 50% dextrose
b. 100 mL of 25% dextrose
c. 250 mL of 10% dextrose
2. Maximum field pediatric dosing: 0.5–1 g/kg of 10–25% dextrose IV
a. 2–4 mL/kg of 25% dextrose for those greater than 8 years old
b. 5–10 mL/kg of 10% dextrose (newborns 2 mL/kg)
ii. Glucagon IM/IN – an option for patients for whom IV access cannot be established
1. Adult dosing: 1 mg IM/IN (or prefilled 3 mg dry powder IN or prefilled IM
autoinjector)
2. Pediatric dosing:
a. 1 mg IM/IN if ≥ 20 kg (or ≥ 5 years old (or prefilled 4 mg dry powder IN for
patients greater than 4 years old or prefilled IM autoinjector)
b. 0.5 mg IM/IN if less than 20 kg (or less than 5 years old)
iii. Remove or disable insulin pump if above treatments cannot be completed
a. For patients with an insulin pump who are hypoglycemic with associated altered mental
status (GCS less than 15):
i. Stop the pump, disconnect, or remove at insertion site if patient cannot ingest oral
glucose or ALS is not available
ii. Leave the pump connected and running if able to ingest oral glucose or receive ALS
interventions
2. Reassess patient
a. Reassess vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, neurologic status assessment)
and mental status
b. Repeat check of blood glucose level if previous hypoglycemia and mental status has not
returned to normal
i. It is not necessary to repeat check of blood glucose level blood sugar if mental status
has returned to normal
c. If maximal field dosage of dextrose solution does not achieve euglycemia and
normalization of mental status:
i. Initiate transport to closest appropriate receiving facility for further treatment of
refractory hypoglycemia
ii. Evaluate for alternative causes of altered mental status
iii. Continue treatment of hypoglycemia using dextrose solutions as noted above
3. Disposition
a. If hypoglycemia with continued symptoms, transport to closest appropriate receiving
facility
b. Hypoglycemic patients who have had a seizure should be transported to the hospital
regardless of their mental status and response to therapy
c. If symptoms of hypoglycemia resolve after treatment, release without transport should
only be considered if all the following are true:

NASEMSO
National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines

Version 3.0

i. Repeat glucose is greater than 80 mg/dL
ii. Patient takes insulin or metformin to control diabetes and does not take long-acting
oral sulphunylurea agents (e.g., glipizide, glyburide, or others)
iii. Patient returns to normal mental status, with no focal neurologic
signs/symptoms after receiving glucose/dextrose
iv. Patient can promptly obtain and will eat a carbohydrate meal
v. Patient or legal guardian refuses transport and EMS clinicians agree transport not
indicated
vi. A reliable adult will be staying with patient
vii. No major co-morbid symptoms exist, like chest pain, shortness of breath,
seizures, intoxication
viii. A clear cause of the hypoglycemia is identified (e.g., missed meal)
Patient Safety Considerations
1. Dextrose 10% can be safely used in all ages of patient. Dextrose 10% works as effectively and
quickly as other concentrations
2. Dextrose 50% can cause local tissue damage if it extravasates from vein and may cause
hyperglycemia. Dextrose 50% carries risk for little clinical gain. EMS systems may consider
carrying no more than 25% concentration of dextrose for treating hypoglycemia in adults
3. For children less than 8 years old, dextrose concentration of no more than 25% should be used
4. For neonates and infants less than 1 month of age, dextrose concentration of no more than 10–
12.5% should be used
5. Sulfonylureas (e.g., glyburide, glipizide) have long half-lives ranging from 12–60 hrs. Patients
with corrected hypoglycemia who are taking these agents are at particular risk for recurrent
symptoms and frequently require hospital admission
Notes/Educational Pearls
A formula for calculating a 0.5 g/kg dose of IV dextrose:
(____% concentration of glucose) x (_____mL/kg) = 50
For example:
Desired
0.5 g/kg
1 g/kg

Fluid type
25% dextrose
10% dextrose
25% dextrose
10% dextrose

mL of fluid Dose
2mL/kg
5mL/kg
4mL/kg
10mL/kg

Key Considerations
1. Using 10% dextrose is as effective and safer than other stronger concentrations
2. Consider contribution of oral diabetic medications to hypoglycemia
3. If possible, have family/patient turn off insulin pump
4. Consider potential for intentional overdose of hypoglycemic agents
5. Avoid overshoot hyperglycemia when correcting hypoglycemia. Administer dextrosecontaining IV fluids in small doses until either mental status improves or a maximum field
dose is achieved

Patient Management
Assessment
1. Routine patient care (e.g., vital signs)
2. History and physical examination focused on potential causes of nausea and vomiting (e.g.,
gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, obstetric, gynecologic, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia,
neurologic, oncologic, psychogenic, or toxidrome) as well as medications that may prolong
the QT interval
3. Obtain glucose level
Treatment and Interventions
1. Antiemetic medication administration
a. Isopropyl alcohol: Allow patient to inhale vapor from isopropyl alcohol wipe 3 times q
(quaque, every) 15 minutes as tolerated
b. Ondansetron (contraindicated for suspected or known diagnosis of prolonged QT
syndrome)
i. Adult:
1. 4 mg IV/PO/SL
OR
2. 4 or 8 mg SL of the ODT formulation
ii. Pediatric (6 months – 14 years old):
1. 0.15 mg/kg IV/PO (maximum dose of 4 mg)
OR
2. 2 mg SL for ages 1–5 years old; age 6 and older use 4 mg of the ODT formulation

2. 0.1 mg/kg IV (maximum 10 mg)
a. May repeat x 1 in 20–30 minutes if no relief
d. Prochlorperazine
i. Adult: 5 mg IV/IM
ii. Pediatric (over 2 years old only and greater than 12 kg):
1. 0.1 mg/kg slow IV
OR
2. 0.1 mg/kg deep IM (maximum 10 mg)
e. Droperidol
i. Adult: 1.25 mg IV/IM (contraindicated for suspected or known diagnosis of prolonged
QT syndrome)
f. Diphenhydramine
i. Adult: 12.5–25 mg IV/IM/PO
ii. Pediatric (over 2 years old only and greater than 12 kg): 0.1 mg/kg IV (maximum 25 mg)
Patient Safety Considerations
1. Ondansetron should not be administered to patients who have a prolonged QT interval as it can
cause torsades.
2. For very young pediatric patients, ondansetron can be sedating
3. Dystonic and extrapyramidal symptoms are possible side effects of antiemetics – If
encountered, consider diphenhydramine:
a. Adult: 25–50 mg IV/IM/PO
b. Pediatric: 1 mg/kg IV/IM/PO (maximum dose 50 mg)
4. Medications that prolong the QT interval may alter treatment options.
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. Ondansetron is preferred in children for the treatment of nausea and vomiting
2. Metoclopramide has fewer adverse effects than prochlorperazine in children
3. Prochlorperazine and metoclopramide (phenothiazines) have an increased risk of dystonic
reactions
a. Some phenothiazines also have an increased risk of respiratory depression when used
with other medications that cause respiratory depression, and some phenothiazines can
cause neuroleptic malignant syndrome
b. Prochlorperazine carries a black box warning for use in elderly patients with dementiarelated psychosis.
4. IV form of ondansetron may be given PO in same dose
5. Nausea and vomiting are symptoms of illness – in addition to treating the patient’s nausea and
vomiting a thorough history and physical are key to identifying what may be a disease in need
of emergent treatment (e.g., bowel obstruction, myocardial infarction, pregnancy)
6. While ondansetron has not been adequately studied in pregnancy to determine safety,
women should be counseled regarding the available data. In the first trimester of
pregnancy, the administration of metoclopramide 5–10 mg IV with diphenhydramine 25
mg IV is recommended over the administration of ondansetron

ii. Ketorolac
1. Adult: 30 mg IM or 15 mg IV
2. Pediatric age 2–16 years old: 0.5 mg/kg (maximum dose of 30 mg IM or 15 mg IV)
c. Nitrous Oxide
6. For Moderate to Severe pain, analgesics include:

i. 0.1 mg/kg IM, IV or IO (maximum initial dose is 10 mg)
b. Fentanyl:
i. 1 mcg/kg IN, IM, IV or IO (maximum initial dose of 100 mcg)
c. Hydromorphone:
i. 0.015 mg/kg IM, IV, or IO (maximum initial dose 2 mg; maximum cumulative
dose of 4 mg)
d. Ketamine:
i. 0.25 mg/kg IM, IV or IO (maximum initial dose 25 mg; maximum cumulative dose 100
mg)
7. Use of non-invasive capnography is an earlier predictor of hypoventilation than pulse
oximetry if opioid medications are administered
8. Consider administration of oral, sublingual, or IV antiemetics to prevent nausea [See
Nausea/Vomiting Guideline]
9. If indicated based on pain assessment, and vital signs allow, repeat pain medication
administration (excluding acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
medicines) after 5 minutes of the previous dose
10. Transport in position of comfort and reassess as indicated
Patient Safety Considerations
1. All patients should have drug allergies identified prior to administration of pain medication
2. Administer opioids with caution to patients with Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) less than 15,
hypotension, identified medication allergy, hypoxia (SPO2 less than 90%) after maximal
supplemental oxygen therapy, or signs of hypoventilation
3. Opioids are contraindicated for patients who have taken monoamine oxidase inhibitors
(MAOI) during the previous 14 days
4. Avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen and ketorolac in patients
with NSAID allergy, aspirin-sensitive asthma, renal insufficiency, pregnancy, or known peptic
ulcer disease
5. Ketorolac should not be used in patients with hypotension (due to renal toxicity)
6. Use of splinting techniques and application of ice should be done to reduce the total
amount of medication used to keep the patient comfortable
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. Intranasal routes of opioid analgesia are preferred as the initial dosing route in
pediatrics where IV access may be problematic; consider in other patient
populations when an IV in not otherwise indicated
2. Onset of action is dependent on the pharmacokinetics of the drug class as well
as route of administration; oral analgesics are effective for pain control but

have a slower onset of action so plan accordingly
3. Pain severity scores should be recorded before and after analgesic medication
administration and upon arrival at destination
4. Patients with acute abdominal pain should receive analgesic interventions – Use of
analgesics for acute abdominal pain does not mask clinical findings or delay diagnosis
5. Opiates may cause a rise in intracranial pressure

Score 0 points if patient has no cry/moan awake or asleep
Score 1 point if patient has occasional moans, cries, whimpers, sighs
Score 2 points if patient has frequent/continuous moans, cries, grunts
Consolability
• Score 0 points if patient is calm and does not require consoling
• Score 1 point if patient responds to comfort by touch or talk in ½ – 1 minute
• Score 2 points if patient require constant consoling or is unconsoled after an extended time
Whenever feasible, behavioral measurement of pain should be used in conjunction with self-report. When selfreport is not possible, interpretation of pain behaviors and decision-making regarding treatment of pain
requires careful consideration of the context in which the pain behaviors were observed.
Each category is scored on a 0–2 scale, which results in a total score of 0–10
Assessment of Behavioral Score:
0 = Relaxed and comfortable
1–3 = Mild discomfort
4–6 = Moderate pain
7–10 = Severe discomfort/pain

Graphic 1. Faces Pain Scale – Revised (FPS-R)

In the following instructions, say "hurt" or "pain", whichever seems right for a particular child. "These faces show
how much something can hurt. This face [point to face on far left] shows no pain. The faces show more and more
pain [point to each from left to right] up to this one [point to face on far right] — it shows very much pain. Point to
the face that shows how much you hurt [right now]."
Score the chosen face 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10, counting left to right, so “0” = “no pain” and “10” = “very much pain”. Do not
use words like “happy” or “sad.” This scale is intended to measure how children feel inside, not how their face looks.

Version 3.0

Treatment and Interventions
1. If signs of airway obstruction are present and a chin-lift, jaw thrust, positioning, and/or
suctioning does not alleviate it, place oropharyngeal airway (if gag reflex is absent) or
nasopharyngeal airway
2. Place pulse oximeter and/or waveform capnography to monitor oxygenation/ventilation
3. Administer oxygen as appropriate with a target of achieving 94–98% saturation. Use bagvalve-mask (BVM) ventilation if oxygenation/ventilation are compromised
4. Assess perfusion
5. Assess neurologic status
6. Routes for treatment
a. IN/IM routes are preferred over IV or IO routes (if not already established) and rectal
(PR) route as an alternative
i.
If no other route of delivery (IM/IV/IO/IN), diazepam 0.2 mg/kg PR (maximum dose
20 mg)
b. IV placement is not necessary for treatment of seizures, but could be obtained if needed
for other reasons
7. Anticonvulsant Treatment
a. If vascular access is absent
i. Midazolam 0.2 mg/kg (maximum dose 10 mg), IM preferred, or IN
b. If vascular access (IV or IO) is present:
i. Diazepam 0.2 mg/kg IV or IO, maximum 10 mg
ii. Lorazepam 0.1 mg/kg IV or IO, maximum 4 mg
iii. Midazolam 0.1 mg/kg IV or IO, maximum 4 mg
8. Glucometry
a. If still actively seizing, check blood glucose level
b. If less than 60 mg/dL, treat per the Hypoglycemia Guideline
9. Administer magnesium sulfate in the presence of seizure in the third trimester of pregnancy or
postpartum [See Eclampsia/Pre-eclampsia Guideline]
10. For febrile seizures, consider the following interventions after stopping the seizure. Please note
that the administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications is contraindicated in
infants less than 6 months of age. The following interventions provide symptomatic relief for
fevers, but do not stop the seizure:
b. Acetaminophen 15 mg/kg, maximum dose 650 mg, PR/IV/IO (if unable to swallow) or PO
(if able to swallow)
AND/OR
c. Ketorolac 1 mg/kg, maximum dose 15 mg, IV (if unable to swallow) OR Ibuprofen 10
mg/kg, maximum dose 600 mg, PO (if able to swallow)
AND/OR
d. Removing excessive layers of clothing
AND/OR
e. Applying cool compresses to the body
11. Consider acquiring a 12-lead EKG following cessation of seizure in patients without a history of
seizure to determine possible cardiac cause

National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines

Version 3.0

Patient Safety Considerations
1. Trained personnel should be able to give medication without contacting medical direction,
however, more than two doses of benzodiazepines are associated with high-risk of airway
compromise
a. Use caution, weigh risks/benefits of deferring treatment until hospital, and/or consider
consultation with medical direction if patient has received two doses of benzodiazepines by
bystanders and/or prehospital clinicians
2. Hypoglycemic patients who are treated in the field for seizure should be transported to hospital,
regardless of whether they return to baseline mental status after treatment
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. Many airway/breathing issues in seizing patients can be managed without intubation or
placement of an advanced airway. Reserve these measures for patients that fail less invasive
maneuvers as noted above
2. For children with convulsive status epilepticus requiring medication management in the
prehospital setting, trained EMS personnel should be allowed to administer medication without
medical direction
3. For new onset seizures or seizures that are refractory to treatment, consider other potential
causes including, but not limited to, trauma, stroke, electrolyte abnormality, toxic ingestion,
pregnancy with eclampsia, hyperthermia
4. A variety of safe and efficacious doses for benzodiazepines have been noted in the literature for
seizures
a. The doses for anticonvulsant treatment noted above are those that are common to the forms
and routes of benzodiazepines noted in this guideline
b. One dose, rather than a range, has been suggested to standardize a common dose in
situations when an EMS agency may need to switch from one type of benzodiazepine to
another due to cost or resource limitations
5. Recent evidence supports the use of midazolam IM as an intervention that is at least as safe and
effective as intravenous lorazepam for prehospital seizure cessation
Pertinent Assessment Findings
The presence of fever with seizure in children less than 6 months old and greater than 6 years
old is not consistent with a simple febrile seizure, and should prompt evaluation for meningitis,
encephalitis, or other cause
Quality Improvement

1. Alternative to a drip, push dose epinephrine may be administered:
a. Prepare 10 mcg/mL by diluting 1 mL of epinephrine 0.1 mg/mL (1:10,000) in 9 mL
of normal saline
b. Administer 0.01 mg/kg (0.1 mL/kg) up to a maximum single dose of 10 mcg (1
mL) q 3–5 minutes titrated to maintain goal MAP. An example is shown below:
• 10 kg child receives 1 mL of the diluted epinephrine
• 20 kg child receives 2 mL of the diluted epinephrine
• 30 kg child receives 3 mL of the diluted epinephrine
iii. Dopamine, 2–20 mcg/kg/minute if norepinephrine or epinephrine is not available or for
other specific causes of shock.
12. For anaphylactic shock, treat per the Anaphylaxis and Allergic Reaction Guideline
13. Provide advanced notification to the hospital
14. Consider empiric antibiotics for suspected septic shock if transport time is anticipated to be
prolonged, if blood cultures can be obtained in advance, and/or EMS has coordinated with
regional receiving hospitals about choice of antibiotic therapy
15. Antipyretics for fever – nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents are contraindicated in infants less
than 6 months of age
a. Acetaminophen (15 mg/kg; maximum dose of 1000 mg)
b. Ibuprofen (10 mg/kg; maximum dose of 800 mg)
Patient Safety Considerations
Recognition of cardiogenic shock - If the patient condition deteriorates after fluid administration,
rales or hepatomegaly develop, then consider cardiogenic shock and withholding further fluid
administration

Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. Early, aggressive IV fluid administration is essential in the treatment of suspected septic shock
2. Patients predisposed to shock:
a. Immunocompromised (patients undergoing chemotherapy or with a primary or
acquired immunodeficiency)
b. Adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, chronic or
recent steroid use)
c. History of a solid organ or bone marrow transplant
d. Infants
e. Elderly
3. In most adults, tachycardia is the first sign of compensated shock, and may persist for hours.
Tachycardia can be a late sign of shock in children and a tachycardic child may be close to
cardiovascular collapse
4. Hypotension indicates uncompensated shock, which may progress to cardiopulmonary
failure within minutes. Hypotension is a late and ominous sign in pediatric
uncompensated shock
5. Hydrocortisone succinate, if available, is preferred over methylprednisolone and
dexamethasone for the patient with adrenal insufficiency because of its dual glucocorticoid
and mineralocorticoid effects
a. Patients with no reported history of adrenal axis dysfunction may have adrenal
suppression due to their acute illness, and hydrocortisone should be considered for any
patient showing signs of treatment-resistant shock
b. Patients with adrenal insufficiency may have an emergency dose of hydrocortisone
available that can be administered IV or IM
Pertinent Assessment Findings
1. Decreased perfusion manifested by altered mental status, or abnormalities in capillary refill or
pulses, decreased urine output (1 mL/kg/hr):
a. Cardiogenic, hypovolemic, obstructive shock: capillary refill greater than 2 seconds,
diminished peripheral pulses, mottled cool extremities
b. Distributive shock: flash capillary refill, bounding peripheral pulses

Patient Care Goals
1. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC)
2. Preservation of neurologic function
3. High-quality chest compressions/CPR with minimal interruption from recognition of cardiac
arrest until confirmation of ROSC or field termination of care
Patient Presentation
Inclusion Criteria
Patients with cardiac arrest
Exclusion Criteria
1. Patients suffering cardiac arrest due to severe hypothermia [See Hypothermia/Cold Exposure
Guideline]
2. Patients with identifiable Do Not Resuscitate (or equivalent such as POLST) order [See Do Not
Resuscitate Status/Advance Directive/Healthcare Power of Attorney (POA) Status Guideline]
3. Patients in arrest due to traumatic etiology [See General Trauma Management Guideline]
Patient Management
Assessment
1. The patient in cardiac arrest requires a prompt balance of treatment and assessment
2. In cases of cardiac arrest, assessments should be focused and limited to obtaining enough
information to reveal the patient is pulseless
3. Once pulselessness is discovered, treatment should be initiated immediately, and any further
history must be obtained by bystanders while treatment is ongoing
Treatment and Interventions
The most important therapies for patients suffering from cardiac arrest are prompt cardiac
defibrillation for shockable rhythms and minimally interrupted effective chest compressions
1. Initiate chest compressions in cases with no bystander chest compressions or take over
compressions from bystanders while a second rescuer is setting up the AED or defibrillator
a. If adequate, uninterrupted bystander CPR has been performed or if the patient arrests in
front of the EMS clinicians, immediately proceed with rhythm analysis and defibrillation, if
appropriate
b. It is realistic for EMS clinicians to tailor the sequence of rescue actions to coincide the
most likely cause of arrest
c. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against delaying defibrillation to
provide a period of CPR for patients in VF/pulseless VT out-of-hospital cardiac arrest

d. For adults and children with unwitnessed cardiac arrest or for whom an AED is not
immediately available, it is reasonable that CPR be initiated while the defibrillator
equipment is being retrieved and applied and that defibrillation, if indicated, be
attempted as soon as the device is ready for use
The maximum setting on the defibrillator should be used for initial and subsequent
defibrillation attempts. Defibrillation dosing should follow manufacturer’s recommendation in
the case of biphasic defibrillators. If the manufacturer’s recommendation is unknown, use
highest setting possible. In the case of monophasic devices, the setting should be 360J (joule)
(or 4 J/kg for children)
Chest compressions should resume immediately after defibrillation attempts with no pauses
for pulse checks for 2 minutes regardless of the rhythm displayed on the cardiac monitor
All attempts should be made to prevent avoidable interruptions in chest compressions, such
as pre-charging the defibrillator and hovering over the chest, rather than stepping away
during defibrillations
If feasible, IV or IO access should be obtained. Administer epinephrine during the first or
second round of compressions. Prioritize early administration of epinephrine for nonshockable rhythms
Continue the cycle of chest compressions for 2 minutes, followed by rhythm analysis and
defibrillation of shockable rhythms; during this period, the proper strategy of airway
management is currently not defined and many options for airway management exist.
Regardless of the airway management and ventilation strategy, consider the following
principles:
a. The airway management strategy should not interrupt compressions
b. Successful resuscitation from cardiac arrest depends primarily on effective, minimally
interrupted chest compressions and prompt defibrillation if the patient is in pulseless
VT/VF. As opposed to children, an adult’s airway management is of secondary importance
and should not interfere with compressions and defibrillation. Options for airway
management include:
i. Passive ventilation:
1. High flow oxygen is applied via a non-rebreather mask with an oropharyngeal
airway
2. Some oxygen will be entrained with each decompression of the chest
3. This may be applied for the first 3–4 compression cycles (6–8 minutes), after
which one may consider BVM ventilation or placement of an advanced airway
ii. BVM ventilation at 10 breaths per minute (1 breath every 10 compressions), applied
during the upstroke between compressions, without interrupting the compressions
iii. BVM ventilation with 30:2 ventilation to compression ratio: Each 30 compressions, the
compressions are paused briefly to allow 2 BVM ventilations, then compressions
immediately resumed
1. Pediatric Consideration: For multiple rescuer CPR in children, 15:2 is the
recommended compression-to-ventilation ratio (30:2 for single rescuer)
2. Pediatric Consideration: For neonates, 3:1 is the recommended compression-toventilation ratio
iv. Advanced airway placement:
1. Either a supraglottic airway or an endotracheal tube may be placed without
interruption of compressions
2. Ventilations are provided at 10 breaths/minute for adults

3. Pediatric Consideration: for children, 1 breath every 3–5 seconds is
recommended (12–20 breaths/minute)
4. Pediatric Consideration: deliver volume needed to achieve chest rise
7. Consider use of antiarrhythmic for recurrent VF/Pulseless VT
a. The principal objective of antiarrhythmic drug therapy in shock-refractory VF and
pulseless VT is to facilitate the restoration and maintenance of a spontaneous perfusing
rhythm in concert with the shock termination of VF/VT; some antiarrhythmic drugs have
been associated with increased rates of ROSC and hospital admission, but none have yet
been proven to increase long-term survival or survival with good neurologic outcome
i. Amiodarone (5 mg/kg IV, max of 300 mg) may be considered for VF/pulseless VT that
is unresponsive to CPR, defibrillation, and a vasopressor therapy
ii. Lidocaine (1 mg/kg IV) may be considered as an alternative to amiodarone for
VF/pulseless VT that is unresponsive to CPR, defibrillation, and vasopressor therapy
iii. The routine use of magnesium for VF/pulseless VT is not recommended in adult
patients unless it is refractory, polymorphic VT, or Torsades de pointes.
b. There is inadequate evidence to support the routine use of lidocaine and beta-blockers
after cardiac arrest by EMS. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the
routine initiation or continuation of other antiarrhythmic medications after ROSC from
cardiac arrest
c. For torsades de pointes, give magnesium sulfate 2 g IV administered over 1–2 minutes (or
25–50 mg/kg for pediatrics). There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against
the routine administration during cardiac arrest
8. Consider reversible causes of cardiac arrest which include the following:
a. Hypothermia – additions to care include attempts at active rewarming [See
Hypothermia/Cold Exposure Guideline]
b. The dialysis patient/known hyperkalemic patient – Additions to care include the following:
i. Calcium gluconate 10% 1 g IV bolus over 2 minutes (for pediatrics, the dose is 100
mg/kg which is 1 mL/kg), can repeat the dose if no response
OR
ii. Calcium chloride 10% 1 g IV bolus over 2 minutes (for pediatrics, the dose is 20 mg/kg
which is 0.2 mL/kg)
iii. Sodium bicarbonate 1 mEq/kg IV
c. Tricyclic antidepressant overdose. Additions to care include sodium bicarbonate 1 mEq/kg
IV
d. Hypovolemia. Additions to care include normal saline 2 L IV (or 20 mL/kg, repeated up to
3 times for pediatrics)
e. If the patient is intubated at the time of arrest, assess for tension pneumothorax and
misplaced ETT
f. If tension pneumothorax suspected, perform needle decompression. Assess ETT, if
misplaced, replace ETT
9. If at any time during this period of resuscitation the patient regains return of spontaneous
circulation, treat per Adult Post-ROSC (Return of Spontaneous Circulation) Care Guideline
10. If resuscitation remains ineffective, consider termination of resuscitation [See Termination of
Resuscitative Efforts Guideline]

Version 3.0

Patient Safety Considerations
1. Performing manual chest compressions in a moving vehicle may pose a clinician safety
concern
2. In addition, manual chest compressions during patient movement are less effective in regard
to hands on time, depth, recoil and rate
3. Ideally, patients should be resuscitated as close to the scene as operationally possible
4. Risks and benefits should be considered before patient movement in cardiac arrest situations
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. Effective chest compressions and defibrillation are the most important therapies to the
patient in cardiac arrest. Effective chest compressions are defined as:
a. A rate of greater than 100 and less than 120 compressions/minute
b. Depth of at least 2 inches (5 cm) and less than 2.4 inches (6 cm) for adults and children or
1.5 inches (4 cm) for infants; adolescents who have entered puberty should receive the
same depth of chest compressions as an adult
c. Allow for complete chest recoil (avoid leaning)
d. Minimize interruptions in compressions
e. Avoid rescuer fatigue by rotating rescuers at least every 2 minutes. Some EMS pit crew
approaches use a clinician on either side of the chest, alternating compressions every
minute or every 100 compressions to avoid fatigue
2. Avoid excessive ventilation and consider delayed airway management – If no advanced
airway, consider:
a. Passive ventilation using an NRB with 3–4 cycles of uninterrupted chest compressions (for
arrests of suspected cardiac etiology). Consider BVM ventilation or advanced airway after
3–4 cycles
b. BVM ventilation every 10–15 compressions with cycles of uninterrupted chest
compressions. Upstroke ventilation between compressions.30:2 ventilation to
compression ratio for adults, and 15:2 for children when 2 rescuers are present
c. If an advanced airway is placed, ventilations should not exceed 10 breaths/minute (1
breath every 6 seconds or 1 breath every 10 compressions) in adults. Pediatric
Consideration: For children with an advanced airway, 1 breath every 3–5 seconds is
recommended (equivalent to 12–20 breaths/minute)
3. Quantitative end-tidal capnography (EtCO2) should be used to monitor effectiveness of chest
compressions
a. If EtCO2 less than 10 mmHg during the initial phases of resuscitation, attempt to improve
chest compression quality
b. Consider additional monitoring with biometric feedback which may improve compliance
with suggested Resuscitation Section
4. Chest compressions are usually the most rapidly applied therapy for the patient in cardiac
arrest and should be initiated as soon as the patient is noted to be pulseless. If the patient is
being monitored with pads in place at the time of arrest, immediate defibrillation should take
precedence over all other therapies. However, if there is any delay in defibrillation (e.g., in
order to place pads), chest compressions should be initiated while the defibrillator is being
applied. There is no guidance on how long these initial compressions should be applied;
however, it is reasonable to either complete between 30 seconds and 2 minutes of chest

compressions in cases of no bystander chest compressions or to perform defibrillation as soon
as possible after chest compressions initiated in cases of witnessed arrest
5. There is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of extracorporeal CPR (ECPR) for
patients with cardiac arrest. In settings where it can be rapidly implemented, ECPR may be
considered for select cardiac arrest patients for whom the suspected etiology of the cardiac
arrest is potentially reversible during a limited period of mechanical cardiorespiratory support
6. Chest compressions should be reinitiated immediately after defibrillation as pulses, if present,
are often difficult to detect and rhythm and pulse checks interrupt compressions
7. Continue chest compressions between completion of AED analysis and AED charging
8. The effectiveness of chest compressions decreases when moving patients
a. Patients should therefore be resuscitated as close to the point at which they are first
encountered and should only be moved if the conditions on scene are unsafe or do not
operationally allow for resuscitation
b. Chest compressions are also less effective in a moving vehicle
c. It is also dangerous to EMS clinicians, patients, pedestrians, and other motorists to
perform chest compressions in a moving ambulance
d. For these reasons and because in most cases the care provided by EMS clinicians is
equivalent to that provided in emergency departments, resuscitation should occur on
scene
9. The maximum setting on the defibrillator should be used for initial and subsequent
defibrillation attempts. Defibrillation dosing should follow manufacturer’s recommendation in
the case of biphasic defibrillators. If the manufacturer’s recommendation is unknown, use
highest setting possible. In the case of monophasic devices, the setting should be 360 J (joule)
(or 4 J/kg for children)
10. IV or IO access without interrupting chest compressions
11. Administer epinephrine (0.1 mg/kg, maximum dose 1 mg) IV/IO during the first or second
round of compressions
12. At present, the most effective mechanism of airway management is uncertain due to some
systems managing the airway aggressively and others managing the airway with basic
measures and both types of systems finding excellent outcomes. Regardless of the airway
management style, consider the following principles:
a. Airway management should not interrupt chest compressions
b. Carefully follow ventilation rate and prevent hyperventilation
c. Consider limited tidal volumes
d. There is uncertainty regarding the proper goals for oxygenation during resuscitation
i. Current recommendations suggest using the highest flow rate possible through NRB
or BVM
ii. This should not be continued into the post-resuscitation phase in which the goal
should be an oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 94–98%
e. Pediatric Considerations: Special attention should be applied to the pediatric population
and airway management/respiratory support. Given that the most likely cause of cardiac
arrest is respiratory, airway management may be considered early in the patient’s care
i. However, the order of Circulation-Airway-Breathing is still recommended as the order
of priority by the American Heart Association for pediatric resuscitation to ensure
timely initiation of chest compressions to maintain perfusion, regardless of the
underlying cause of the arrest

ii. In addition, conventional CPR is preferred in children, since it is associated with better
outcomes when compared to compression-only CPR
13. Special Circumstances in Cardiac Arrest
a. Trauma, treat per the General Trauma Management Guideline
b. Pregnancy
i. The best hope for fetal survival is maternal survival
ii. Position the patient in the supine position with a second rescuer performing manual
uterine displacement to the left to displace the gravid uterus and increase venous
return by avoiding aorto-caval compression
iii. If manual displacement is unsuccessful, the patient may be placed in the left lateral tilt
position at 30°. This position is less desirable than the manual uterine displacement as
chest compressions are more difficult to perform in this position
iv. Chest compressions should be performed slightly higher on the sternum than in the
non-pregnant patient to account for elevation of the diaphragm and abdominal
contents in the obviously gravid patient
v. Defibrillation should be performed as in non-pregnant patients
c. Arrests of respiratory etiology (including drowning). In addition to the above, consider
early management of the patient’s airway. Passive ventilation with a NRB is not indicated
for these patients
14. Application of the “pit crew” model of resuscitation
a. Ideally, clinicians in each EMS agency will use a “pit crew” approach when using this
protocol to ensure the most effective and efficient cardiac arrest care. Training should
include teamwork simulations integrating first responders, BLS, and ALS crewmembers
who regularly work together. High-performance systems should practice teamwork using
“pit crew” techniques with predefined roles and crew resource management principles.
For example (the Pennsylvania State EMS Model for Pit Crew):
i. Rescuer 1 and 2 set up on opposite sides of patient’s chest and perform continuous
chest compressions, alternating after every 100 compressions to avoid fatigue
ii. Use a metronome or CPR feedback device to ensure that compression rate is 100–
120/minute
iii. Chest compressions are only interrupted during rhythm check (AED analysis or
manual) and defibrillation shocks – Continue compressions when AED/defibrillator is
charging
iv. Additional rescuer obtains IO (or IV) access and gives epinephrine. For IO access:
1. The proximal humerus is the preferred site for adults
2. The tibial site is preferred for infants and children
v. During the first four cycles of compressions/defibrillation (approximately 10 minutes)
avoid advanced airway placement
vi. One responding clinician assumes code leader position overseeing the entire response
vii. Use a CPR checklist to ensure that all best practices are followed during CPR
b. For efficient “pit crew” style care, the EMS agency medical director should establish the
options that will be used by clinicians functioning within the EMS agency. Options include
establishing:
i. The airway/ventilation management, if any, that will be used
ii. The initial route of vascular access
15. The EMS agency must perform a Quality Improvement (QI) review of care and outcome,
overseen by the agency medical director, for every patient that receives CPR

Patient Care Goals
The immediate ROSC period is critical in stabilizing patients and preparing for transport. The goal is
therefore to maximize survival and optimize neurologic and cardiovascular function following a return of
spontaneous circulation by the following steps:
Secure airway
Obtain vascular access
Maximize blood pressure
Identify ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or reversible causes of arrest
Recognize pending re-arrest
Consider appropriate destination choice
Patient Presentation
Inclusion Criteria
Patient returned to spontaneous circulation following cardiac arrest resuscitation
Exclusion Criteria
None noted
Patient Management
Assessment, Treatment, and Interventions
1. Perform general patient assessment attempting to identify cause of cardiac arrest.
2. Support life-threatening problems associated with airway, breathing, and circulation.
a. For example, most of the pediatric cardiac arrest occurs due to non-cardiac causes such as
respiratory failure (hypoxemia) or shock (hypovolemia).
3. Monitor closely for recurrence of cardiac arrest using clinical and adjunctive criteria such as
cardiac monitoring, EtCO2 monitoring, and physical signs of perfusion
4. Administer oxygen as appropriate with a target of achieving 94–98% saturation.
Do not hyperoxygenate.
5. Do not hyperventilate. Maintain a ventilation rate of 8–10 breaths per minute, targeting an
EtCO2 of 35–45 mmHg.
6. For hypotension (SBP less than 90 mmHg or MAP less than 65 in adults) see Shock Guideline
7. Perform serial 12-lead EKGs to assess for evidence of reversible cause of arrest such as STEMI
or electrolyte derangement (e.g., hyperkalemia)
8. Post-cardiac arrest patients with evidence or interpretation consistent with ST elevation
myocardial infarction (STEMI/acute MI) should be transported preferably to a facility capable
of emergent cardiac catheterization or, as a secondary option, to a STEMI receiving facility
based upon local resources and system of care
9. Check blood glucose
a. If hypoglycemic, treat per Hypoglycemia Guideline
b. If hyperglycemic, notify hospital on arrival

10. If patient seizes, treat per Seizures Guideline
11. Consider transporting patients to an age-appropriate facility which offers specialized adult or
pediatric post-resuscitation care
Patient Safety Considerations
1. Avoid hyperthermia (temperature greater than 37.5° C or 99.5° F) by avoiding excessive
environmental heat exposure, warm blankets, etc.
a. Beyond interventions to prevent hyperthermia or fever, prehospital initiation of
therapeutic hypothermia (targeted temperature management) is not routinely
recommended
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. Hyperventilation is a significant cause of hypotension and recurrence of cardiac arrest in the
post resuscitation phase and must be avoided. Similarly, hypoventilation (suggested by an
EtCO2 greater than 40–45) contributes to worsening acidosis and may precipitate re-arrest
2. Most patients are comatose immediately after resuscitation and will require airway
management and ventilatory assistance
3. Many patients experience “stunning” of the cardiac muscle after ROSC. Hypotension is
common, and volume resuscitation or vasopressor support is often required. Refer to the
[Shock Guideline] for further recommendations
4. Common non-cardiac causes of post-resuscitation hypotension include hyperventilation,
hypovolemia, and traumatic pneumothorax from chest compressions
5. The condition of post-resuscitation patients fluctuates rapidly and continuously requiring close
monitoring. A significant percentage of post-ROSC patients will re-arrest
6. Current research has demonstrated that care of patients with ROSC at specialized centers is
associated with both decreased mortality and improved neurologic outcomes
7. Maintain mechanical CPR device in place in preparation for re-arrest
8. A moderate number of adult post-ROSC patients may have transient ST-elevation on EKG
Consider performing serial EKGs. Post-ROSC patients should preferentially be transported to
centers capable of managing STEMI, whenever possible

Patient Care Goals
All clinically dead patients will receive all available resuscitative efforts including cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR) unless contraindicated by one of the exceptions defined below
Patient Presentation
A clinically dead patient is defined as any unresponsive patient found without respirations and without a
palpable carotid pulse
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria:
1. Resuscitation should be started on all patients who are found apneic and pulseless unless the
following conditions exist (does not apply to victims of lightning strikes, drowning, or
hypothermia):
a. Medical cause or traumatic injury or body condition clearly indicating biological death
(irreversible brain death), limited to:
i. Decapitation: the complete severing of the head from the remainder of the patient’s
body
ii. Decomposition or putrefaction: the skin is bloated or ruptured, with or without soft
tissue sloughed off. The presence of at least one of these signs indicated death
occurred at least 24 hours previously
iii. Transection of the torso: the body is completely cut across below the shoulders and
above the hips through all major organs and vessels. The spinal column may or may
not be severed
iv. Incineration: 90% of body surface area with full thickness burns as exhibited by ash
rather than clothing and complete absence of body hair with charred skin
v. Injuries incompatible with life (such as massive crush injury, complete exsanguination,
severe displacement of brain matter)
vi. Futile and inhumane attempts as determined by agency policy/protocol related to
“compelling reasons” for withholding resuscitation
vii. In blunt and penetrating trauma, if the patient is apneic, pulseless, and without other
signs of life upon EMS arrival including, but not limited to spontaneous movement,
EKG activity, or pupillary response
viii. Nontraumatic arrest with obvious signs of death including dependent lividity or rigor
mortis
OR
b. A valid DNR order (form, card, bracelet) or other actionable medical order (e.g., Physician
Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST)/Medical Orders for Life-Sustaining
Treatment (MOLST) form) is present, and it:
i. Conforms to the state specifications for color and construction
ii. Is intact: it has not been cut, broken, or shows signs of being repaired
iii. Displays the patient’s name and, if required by state law or regulation, the physician’s
name

Patient Management
Assessment
Assess for dependent lividity with rigor mortis and/or other inclusion criteria
Treatment and Interventions
1. If all the components above are confirmed, no CPR is required
2. If CPR has been initiated but all the components above have been subsequently confirmed,
CPR should be discontinued, and medical direction contacted as needed
3. If any of the findings are different than those described above, clinical death is not confirmed,
and resuscitative measures should be immediately initiated or continued. The Termination of
Resuscitative Efforts Guideline should then be implemented
4. Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order (DNR/MOLST/POLST) with signs of life:
a. If there is a DNR bracelet or DNR transfer form and there are signs of life (pulse and
respirations), provide standard appropriate treatment under existing protocols matching
the patient’s condition
b. To request permission to withhold treatment under these conditions for any reason
contact medical direction
c. If there is documentation of a Do Not Intubate (DNI/MOLST/POLST) advanced directive,
the patient should receive full treatment per protocols except for any intervention
specifically prohibited in the patient’s advanced directive
d. If for any reason an intervention that is prohibited by an advanced directive is being
considered, contact medical direction
Patient Safety Considerations
In cases where the patient's status is unclear and the appropriateness of withholding resuscitation
efforts is questioned, EMS personnel should initiate CPR immediately and then contact medical
direction
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. For scene safety and/or family wishes, clinician may decide to implement CPR even if all the
criteria for death are met
2. At a likely crime scene, disturb as little potential evidence as possible

Patient Care Goals
To acknowledge and maintain the variety of ways that patients can express their wishes about
cardiopulmonary resuscitation or end-of-life decision making
Patient Presentation
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
1. Patients must have one of the following documents or a valid alternative (such as
identification bracelet indicating wishes) immediately available. Note that some specifics can
vary widely from state to state:
a. Physician Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment (POLST) or Medical Orders for Life
Sustaining Treatment (MOLST) – explicitly describes acceptable interventions for the
patient in the form of medical orders, must be signed by a physician or other empowered
medical clinician to be valid
b. Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order – identifies that CPR and intubation are not to be initiated
if the patient is in arrest or peri-arrest. The interventions covered by this order and the
details around when to implement them can vary widely
c. Advance directives – document that describes acceptable treatments under a variable
number of clinical situations including some or all the following: what to do for cardiac
arrest, whether artificial nutrition is acceptable, organ donation wishes, dialysis, and other
parameters. The directives frequently do not apply to emergent or potentially transient
medical conditions
d. As specified from state to state, in the absence of formal written directions (MOLST,
POLST, DNR, advanced directives), and in the presence of a person with power of attorney
for healthcare or healthcare proxy, that person may prescribe limits of treatment
2. One of the documents above is valid when it meets all the following criteria:
a. Conforms to the state specifications for color and construction
b. Is intact: it has not been cut, broken or shows signs of being repaired
c. Displays the patient’s name and, if required by state law or regulation, the physician’s
name
3. If there is question about the validity of the form/instrument, the best course of action is to
proceed with the resuscitation until additional information can be obtained to clarify the best
course of action
4. If a patient has a valid version of one of the above documents, it will be referred to as a “valid
exclusion to resuscitation” for the purposes of this protocol
Patient Management
Assessment
1. If the patient has a valid exclusion to resuscitation, then no CPR or airway management should
be attempted, however this does not exclude comfort measures including medications for

pain as appropriate
2. If CPR has been initiated and a valid exclusion to resuscitation has been subsequently verified,
CPR may be discontinued, and medical direction contacted as needed
Treatment and Interventions
1. If there is a valid exclusion to resuscitation and there are signs of life (pulse and
respirations), EMS clinicians should provide standard appropriate treatment under existing
protocols according to the patient’s condition
a. If the patient has a MOLST or POLST, it may provide specific guidance on how to proceed
in this situation
b. Directives should be followed as closely as possible and medical direction contacted as
needed
2. The patient should receive full treatment per protocols with the exception of any intervention
specifically prohibited in the patient’s valid exclusion to resuscitation
3. If for any reason an intervention that is prohibited by an advanced directive is being
considered, medical direction should be contacted
Patient Safety Considerations
In cases where the patient's status is unclear and the appropriateness of withholding resuscitation
efforts is questioned, EMS personnel should initiate CPR immediately and contact medical
direction
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. If there is a personal physician present at the scene who has an ongoing relationship with the
patient, that physician may decide if resuscitation is to be initiated
2. If there is a registered nurse from a home healthcare or hospice agency present at the scene
who has an ongoing relationship with the patient and who is operating under orders from the
patient’s private physician, that nurse (authorized nurse) may decide if resuscitation is to be
initiated
3. If the physician or nurse decides resuscitation is to be initiated, usual medical direction
procedures will be followed
4. Special Consideration: For scene safety and/or family wishes, the EMS clinician may decide to
implement CPR even if all the criteria for death are met

Patient Care Goals
1. When there is no response to prehospital cardiac arrest treatment, it is acceptable and often
preferable to cease futile resuscitation efforts in the field
2. In patients with cardiac arrest, prehospital resuscitation is initiated with the goal of returning
spontaneous circulation before permanent neurologic damage occurs. In most situations, ALS
clinicians are capable of performing an initial resuscitation that is equivalent to an in-hospital
resuscitation attempt, and there is usually no additional benefit to emergency department
resuscitation in most cases
3. CPR that is performed during patient packaging and transport is much less effective than CPR
done at the scene. Additionally, EMS clinicians risk physical injury while attempting to perform
CPR in a moving ambulance while unrestrained. In addition, continuing resuscitation in futile
cases places other motorists and pedestrians at risk, increases the time that EMS crews are
not available for another call, impedes emergency department care of other patients, and
incurs unnecessary hospital charges. Lastly, return of spontaneous circulation is dependent on
a focused, timely resuscitation. The patient in arrest should be treated as expeditiously as
possible, including quality, uninterrupted CPR and timely defibrillation as indicated
4. When cardiac arrest resuscitation becomes futile, the patient’s family should become the
focus of the EMS clinicians. Families need to be informed of what is being done and that
transporting all cardiac arrest patients to the hospital is not supported by evidence. This
practice also inconveniences the family by requiring a trip to the hospital where they must
begin grieving in an unfamiliar setting. Most families understand the futility of the situation
and are accepting of ceasing resuscitation efforts in the field
5. Consider potential for organ donation if feasible.
Patient Presentation
Patient in cardiac arrest
Inclusion Criteria
1. Any cardiac arrest patient that has received resuscitation in the field but has not responded to
treatment
2. When resuscitation has begun and it is found that the patient has a DNR order or other
actionable medical order (e.g., POLST/MOLST form)
Exclusion Criteria
Consider continuing resuscitation for patients in cardiac arrest associated with medical conditions
that may have a better outcome despite prolonged resuscitation, including hypothermia (although
under certain circumstances, medical direction may order termination of resuscitation in these
conditions)
Patient Management
Resuscitation may be terminated under the following circumstances:

1. Non-traumatic arrest
a. Patient is at least 18 years of age
b. Patient is in cardiac arrest at the time of arrival of advanced life support (ALS)
i. No pulse
ii. No respirations
iii. No evidence of meaningful cardiac activity (e.g., asystole or wide complex PEA less
than 60 BPM, no heart sounds)
c. ALS resuscitation is administered appropriate to the presenting and persistent cardiac
rhythm.
i. Resuscitation may be terminated in asystole and slow wide complex PEA if there is
1. No return of spontaneous circulation after 20 minutes in the absence of
hypothermia
AND
2. The EtCO2 is less than 20 mmHg
ii. Narrow complex PEA with a rate above 40 or refractory and recurrent ventricular
fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia:
1. Consider resuscitation for up to 60 minutes from the time of dispatch.
2. Termination efforts may be ceased before 60 minutes based on factors including,
but not limited to, EtCO2 less than 20 mmHg, age, co-morbidities, distance from,
and resources available at the closest hospital. Termination before this timeframe
should be done in consultation with online medical direction
d. There is no return of spontaneous pulse and no evidence of neurological function (nonreactive pupils, no response to pain, no spontaneous movement)
e. No evidence or suspicion of hypothermia
f. All EMS clinicians involved in the patient’s care agree that discontinuation of the
resuscitation is appropriate
g. Consider contacting medical direction before termination of resuscitative efforts
2. Traumatic arrest
a. Patient is at least 18 years of age
b. Resuscitation efforts may be terminated in any blunt trauma patient who, based on
thorough primary assessment, is found apneic, pulseless, and asystolic on an EKG or
cardiac monitor upon arrival of emergency medical services at the scene
c. Victims of penetrating trauma found apneic and pulseless by EMS should be rapidly
assessed for the presence of other signs of life, such as pupillary reflexes, spontaneous
movement, response to pain, and electrical activity on EKG
i. Resuscitation may be terminated by contacting medical direction oversight if these
signs of life are absent
ii. If resuscitation is not terminated, transport is indicated
d. Cardiopulmonary arrest patients in whom mechanism of injury does not correlate with
clinical condition, suggesting a non-traumatic cause of arrest, should have standard ALS
resuscitation initiated
e. All EMS personnel involved in the patient’s care agree that discontinuation of the
resuscitation is appropriate
f. Consider contacting medical direction before termination of resuscitative efforts

movement, pupillary response]
4. Cardiac activity (cardiac auscultation, cardiac monitoring, and/or, if available,

5. Quantitative capnography
Treatment and Interventions
1. Focus on continuous, quality CPR that is initiated as soon as possible
2. Focus attention on the family and/or bystanders. Explain the rationale for termination
3. Consider support for family members such as other family, friends, clergy, faith leaders, or
chaplains
4. For patients that are less than 18 years of age, consultation with medical direction is
recommended
Patient Safety Considerations
All patients who are found in ventricular fibrillation or whose rhythm changes to ventricular
fibrillation should in general have full resuscitation continued on scene
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations and Pertinent Assessment Findings
1. Recent evidence has shown that, to capture over 99% of potential survivors from medical
cardiac arrest (especially VF and pulseless VT arrests), resuscitation should be continued for
approximately 40 minutes. This does not imply, however, that all resuscitations should
continue this long (e.g., asystolic rhythms)
2. In remote or wilderness situations, EMS clinicians should make every effort to contact medical
direction, but resuscitation may be terminated in the field without contacting medical
direction when the following have occurred:
a. There has been no return of pulse despite greater than 30 minutes of CPR (this does not
apply in the case of hypothermia)
b. Transport to an emergency department will take greater than 30 minutes (this does not
apply in the case of hypothermia)
c. EMS clinicians are exhausted, and it is physically impossible to continue the resuscitation
3. Logistical factors should be considered, such as collapse in a public place, family wishes, and
safety of the crew and public
4. Survival and functional neurologic outcomes are unlikely if ROSC is not obtained by EMS. It is
dangerous to crew, pedestrians, and other motorists to attempt to resuscitate a patient
during ambulance transport
5. Quantitative EtCO2 measurements of less than 10 mmHg or falling greater than 25% despite
resuscitation indicates a poor prognosis and provide additional support for termination

Resuscitation in Traumatic Cardiac Arrest
Aliases
Traumatic Cardiac Arrest (TCA)
Patient Care Goals
1. Return of spontaneous circulation
2. Treatment and resolution of the underlying pathophysiology leading to the traumatic cardiac
arrest
3. When appropriate, transport to the closest and most capable hospital within the defined
trauma system
Patient Presentation
Inclusion Criteria
Patients suffering blunt or penetrating trauma with cardiac arrest after arrival of EMS clinicians or
while under the care of EMS clinicians (witnessed arrest or recent arrest with continued signs of
life)
Exclusion Criteria
1. When the mechanism of injury does not correlate with the clinical condition, suggesting a
nontraumatic cause of cardiac arrest, standard resuscitative measures should be followed. In
such cases, refer to the Resuscitation Section
2. In victims of blunt or penetrating trauma with pulses or other signs of life on EMS clinician
assessment refer to the General Trauma Management Guideline
3. In victims of blunt or penetrating trauma with rigor mortis, lividity, or evidence of injuries
incompatible with life (including decapitation, hemicorporectomy). In such cases, refer to
Determination of Death/Withholding Resuscitative Efforts Guideline
4. Resuscitation efforts may be withheld in any blunt trauma patient who, based on thorough
primary assessment, is found apneic, pulseless, and asystolic on an EKG or cardiac monitor
upon arrival of emergency medical services at the scene. In such cases, refer to the
Determination of Death/Withholding Resuscitative Efforts Guideline
5. Resuscitation efforts may be withheld in victims of penetrating trauma found apneic,
pulseless, and without other signs of life including pupillary reflexes, respiratory effort,
spontaneous movement, response to pain, and electrical activity on EKG. In such cases, refer
to the Determination of Death/Withholding Resuscitative Efforts Guideline
Patient Management
Assessment
1. Management of traumatic cardiac arrest requires a balance of rapid, focused evaluation
followed by prompt treatment of reversible life threats, including management of massive
hemorrhage, airway management, decompression of tension pneumothorax, and
resuscitation
2. Assess for signs of life, including pulses, respiratory effort, and evaluation of other signs of life
3. Assess for evidence of massive hemorrhage
a. Including evidence of massive external hemorrhage

b. Evidence of pelvic injury (such as instability)
4. Assess the patient’s airway
5. Assess the patient’s respiratory effort, if present, or for evidence of tension pneumothorax
6. Assess vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, neurologic status assessment)
Treatment and Interventions
1. Manage massive hemorrhage. Refer to General Trauma Management Guideline for complete
list of therapies for the treatment of massive hemorrhage, including the following:
a. Place tourniquets for wounds amenable to tourniquet placement
b. Use a combination of wound packing and direct pressure for junctional wounds or
junctional tourniquets if available
c. Place a pelvic binder on all patients with blunt or blast trauma suffering traumatic arrest
2. Manage the patient’s airway. Refer to the Airway Management Guideline
3. Perform bilateral, rapid chest decompression
4. Establish intravenous access
5. Initiate volume resuscitation and adjunctive hemorrhage control measures (such as
tranexamic acid (TXA)) en route to the hospital
Patient Safety Considerations
None noted
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. Survival from traumatic cardiac arrest requires careful coordination between rapid prehospital
assessment, EMS clinician treatment of reversible causes of traumatic cardiac arrest and
transport that is rapid, but also allows maintenance of necessary therapies in a manner that is
effective for patients as well as safe for EMS clinicians
2. Evidence for the benefit of CPR in traumatic cardiac arrest is limited. Treatment priorities
should initially focus on control of massive hemorrhage (including management of pelvis
fractures), airway management, and consideration of bilateral needle thoracostomy. If CPR is
performed at all, it should be performed en route to the hospital but only if it can be
performed in a safe and effective manner by EMS clinicians
3. Unless there is an immediate and correctable cause, patients suffering traumatic cardiac
arrest have the best chance for survival when arrival time to a hospital is within minutes
4. If transport is initiated, consider the ACS-COT’s Once the above treatments and interventions
have been performed, patients should be transported to the closest appropriate hospital
within the defined trauma system
5. In an effort to reduce on-scene time, consider IV/IO access and initiation of resuscitation
during transport
6. Optimal choices for resuscitation are (in descending order as available) as follows: whole
blood, balanced blood products (red blood cells (RBC), plasma), packed red blood cells alone,
liquid, or freeze-dried plasma alone, no fluid resuscitation. Excessive crystalloid and colloid
have little to no value and may in fact be harmful in hemorrhagic shock
7. Consider the duration of resuscitation and transport, contact online medical direction if
available to discuss. If termination of resuscitation is advised, refer to the Termination of
Resuscitation Efforts Guideline

4. Transport the patient to the appropriate facility even if they appear well or have returned to
their baseline
Patient Safety Considerations
1. Regardless of the patient’s well appearance, all infants with a history of signs or symptoms
suggestive of BRUE should be transported for further evaluation
a. By definition, infants who are not completely well-appearing at EMS evaluation do not
meet the definition of possible BRUE and should be treated and transported according to
local guidelines
2. Destination considerations
a. All patients should be transported to facilities with at least baseline pediatric readiness,
i.e., appropriate equipment, resources, and trained staff capable of providing initial
emergency care and stabilization to pediatric patients prior to hospital admission or
interfacility transfer, if feasible
b. Consider transport to a facility with pediatric critical care capability for patients with any
high-risk criteria:
i.
ii.
iii.
iv.
v.

Less than 2 months of age
History of prematurity (less than or equal to 32 weeks gestation)
More than one BRUE, now or in the past
Event duration greater than 1 minute
CPR or resuscitation by caregivers or trained rescuers

Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. BRUE is a group of symptoms, not a disease process
2. If the infant is not completely well upon EMS arrival, this excludes possible BRUE event:
a. Treat and transport according to local guidelines
3. Avoid using “BRUE”, “ALTE”, “SIDS” (sudden infant death syndrome), or “near-miss SIDS”
terminology with parent/guardian
4. EMS clinicians play a unique and important role in obtaining an accurate history soon after the
event and in observing, documenting, and reporting environmental, scene and social
indicators that may point to an alternate diagnosis
5. High-risk patients with a possible BRUE have worse outcomes and may require emergency
department (ED) or inpatient testing, intervention, and/or follow-up
6. The determination of a BRUE is made only after hospital evaluation, not in the field:
a. A few of these infants will die even after hospital evaluation and treatment
7. All patients should be transported to an ED
8. Contact medical direction if parent/guardian is refusing medical care and/or transport,
especially if any high-risk criteria are present

a. Full set of vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, neurologic status
assessment) temperature, and O2 saturation
b. Air entry (normal vs. diminished)
c. Breath sounds (wheezes, crackles, rales, rhonchi, diminished, clear)
d. Signs of distress (grunting, nasal flaring, retracting, accessory muscle use)
e. Weak cry or inability to speak full sentences (sign of shortness of breath)
f. Color (pallor, cyanosis, normal)
g. Mental status (alert, tired, lethargic, unresponsive)
h. Hydration status (+/- sunken eyes, delayed capillary refill, mucous membranes (moist vs.
tacky), fontanel (flat vs. sunken))
Treatment and Interventions
1. Pulse oximetry and end-tidal capnography (EtCO2) should be routinely used as an adjunct to
other forms of respiratory monitoring
2. Perform EKG only if there are no signs of clinical improvement after treating respiratory
distress
3. Airway
a. Give supplemental oxygen – escalate from a nasal cannula to a simple face mask to a nonbreather mask as needed, to maintain normal oxygenation (goal SpO2 94–98%)
b. Suction the nose and/or mouth (via bulb or suction catheter) particularly if excessive
secretions are present
4. Inhaled medications – nebulized epinephrine 5 mg (5 mL of 1 mg/mL solution) should be
administered to children in severe respiratory distress with bronchiolitis in the prehospital
setting if other treatments (e.g., suctioning, oxygen) fail to result in clinical improvement; if
immediate reassessment after treatment does not demonstrate clinical improvement, airway
management should be escalated as necessary (see below and refer to Airway Management
Guideline)
5. Utility of IV placement and fluids. IVs should only be placed in children with respiratory
distress for clinical concerns of dehydration, or when administering IV medications.
Otherwise, IV access is not routinely needed in bronchiolitis.
6. Steroids are not efficacious and should not be given
7. Improvement of oxygenation and/or respiratory distress with non-invasive airway adjuncts
a. High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) can be
administered, when available, for severe respiratory distress
b. Bag-valve-mask ventilation should be utilized in children with respiratory failure or
impending respiratory failure
8. Supraglottic devices and intubation
a. Supraglottic devices and intubation should be utilized only if bag-valve-mask (BVM)
ventilation fails
b. The airway should be managed in the least invasive way possible
Patient Safety Considerations
Routine use of lights and sirens is not recommended during transport

Version 3.0

Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. Suctioning can be a very effective intervention to alleviate distress since infants are obligate
nose breathers
2. Heliox should not be routinely administered to children with respiratory distress
3. Insufficient data exist to recommend the use of inhaled steam or nebulized saline
4. Although albuterol and steroids have previously been a consideration, the most recent
evidence does not demonstrate a benefit in routine use of albuterol or steroids for
bronchiolitis
5. Ipratropium and other anticholinergic agents should not be given to children with bronchiolitis
in the prehospital setting
6. Although nebulized hypertonic saline has been shown to decrease hospital length of stay
when used for bronchiolitis, it does not provide immediate relief of distress and should not
be administered to children in respiratory distress in the prehospital setting
Pertinent Assessment Findings
Frequent reassessment is necessary to determine if interventions have alleviated signs of
respiratory distress.

Airway
a. Give supplemental oxygen. Escalate from a nasal cannula to a simple face mask to a nonbreather mask to SPO2 94-98%
b. Suction the nose and/or mouth (via bulb or suction catheter) if excessive secretions are
present
Inhaled medications should be administered to all children with croup in respiratory distress
with signs of stridor at rest—these medications should be repeated at this dose with unlimited
frequency for ongoing respiratory distress
a. Epinephrine 5 mg (5 mL of 1 mg/mL solution) nebulized (may repeat in 20 minutes as
needed), or
b. Racemic epinephrine 0.5 mL of 2.25% solution mixed in 2.5 mL NS (may repeat in 20
minutes as needed)
c. Humidified oxygen or mist therapy is not indicated
Dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg oral, IV, or IM to maximum dose of 16 mg should be administered
to patients with suspected croup
Utility of IV placement and fluids. IVs should only be placed in children with respiratory
distress for clinical concerns of dehydration or when administering IV medications
Improvement of oxygenation and/or respiratory distress with non-invasive airway adjuncts
a. Heliox for the treatment of croup can be considered for severe distress not responsive to
more than 2 doses of epinephrine
b. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) should be administered for severe respiratory
distress
c. BVM ventilation should be utilized in children with respiratory failure
Supraglottic devices and intubation — should be utilized only if BVM ventilation fails. The
airway should be managed in the least invasive way possible

Patient Safety Considerations
1. Routine use of lights and sirens is not recommended during transport
2. Patients who receive inhaled epinephrine should be transported to definitive care
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. Upper airway obstruction can have inspiratory, expiratory, or biphasic stridor
2. Foreign bodies can mimic croup, it is important to ask about a possible choking event
3. Impending respiratory failure is indicated by:
a. Change in mental status such as fatigue and listlessness
b. Pallor
c. Dusky appearance
d. Decreased retractions
e. Decreased breath sounds with decreasing stridor
4. Without stridor at rest or other evidence of respiratory distress, inhaled medications may not
be necessary
Pertinent Assessment Findings
1. Respiratory distress (retractions, wheezing, stridor, accessory muscle use)

Treatment and Interventions
1. If immediate resuscitation is required and the newborn is still attached to the mother, clamp
the cord in two places and cut between the clamps. If no resuscitation is required,
warm/dry/stimulate the newborn, and then cut/clamp the cord after 60 seconds or the cord
stops pulsating
2. Dry, warm, and stimulate
a. Wrap infant in dry towel or thermal blanket to keep infant as warm as possible during
resuscitation; keep head covered if possible
b. If strong cry, regular respiratory effort, good tone, and term gestation, infant should be
placed skin-to-skin with mother and covered with dry linen
3. If weak cry, signs of respiratory distress, poor tone, or preterm gestation then position airway
(sniffing position) and clear airway as needed. If signs of respiratory distress with airway
obstruction, suction mouth then nose; routine suctioning is not recommended
4. Apply cardiac monitor, if available
5. If heart rate greater than 100 BPM
a. Monitor for central cyanosis — provide blow-by oxygen as needed
b. Monitor for signs of respiratory distress. If apneic or in significant respiratory distress:
i. Ventilate: BVM ventilation with room air at 40–60 breaths per minute
1. Positive pressure ventilation (PPV) with bag-mask device may be initiated with
room air (21% oxygen) in term and late preterm babies; otherwise use 100%
oxygen
2. Goal: SPO2 at 10 minutes is 85–95%
ii. Consider endotracheal intubation per local guidelines
6. Evaluate: If heart rate less than 100 BPM
a. Initiate BVM ventilation with room air at 40–60 breaths per minute for 90 seconds with
room air
i. Primary indicator of effective ventilation is improvement in heart rate
ii. Evaluate heart rate every 30 seconds
iii. Rates and volumes of ventilation required can be variable, only use the minimum
necessary rate and volume to achieve chest rise and a change in heart rate; can control
rate and volume by saying “squeeze, release” – squeeze the bag just until chest rise is
indicated then release to allow for exhalation
b. If no improvement after 90 seconds, change oxygen delivery to 30% FiO 2 (fraction of
inspired oxygen) if blender available, otherwise 100% FiO2 until heart rate normalizes
c. Consider endotracheal intubation or supraglottic airway per local guidelines if BVM
ventilation is ineffective
7. Resuscitate: If heart rate less than 60 BPM:
a. Ensure effective ventilations with supplementary oxygen and adequate chest rise
b. If no improvement after 30 seconds, initiate chest compressions — two-thumb-encirclinghands technique is preferred
c. Coordinate chest compressions with positive pressure ventilation (3:1 ratio, 90
compressions and 30 breaths per minute)
d. Consider endotracheal intubation or supraglottic airway per local guidelines
e. Administer epinephrine (0.1 mg/mL) 0.01 mg/kg IV/IO (preferable if access obtained) or
0.1 mg/kg via the ETT (if unable to obtain access) q 3–5 min if heart rate remains less than
60 BPM

8. Consider checking a blood glucose for ongoing resuscitation, maternal history of diabetes, ill
appearing or unable to feed
9. Administer 20 mL/kg normal saline IV/IO for signs of shock or post-resuscitative care
Patient Safety Considerations
1. Hypothermia is common in newborns and worsens outcomes of nearly all post-natal
complications
a. Ensure heat retention by drying the infant thoroughly, covering the head, and wrapping
the baby in dry cloth
b. When it does not encumber necessary assessment or required interventions, “kangaroo
care” (i.e., placing the infant skin-to-skin directly against mother’s chest and wrapping
them together) is an effective warming technique
c. Newborn infants are prone to hypothermia which may lead to hypoglycemia, hypoxia, and
lethargy. Aggressive warming techniques should be initiated including drying, swaddling,
and warm blankets covering body and head. When available, radiant warmers or other
warming adjuncts are suggested for babies who require resuscitation, especially for
preterm babies. Check blood glucose and follow Hypoglycemia Guideline as appropriate
2. During transport, neonate should be appropriately secured (e.g., secured to mother with
approved neonatal restraint system, car seat or isolette) and mother should be appropriately
secured
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. Approximately 10% of newly born infants require some assistance to begin breathing at birth
and 1% require resuscitation to support perfusion
2. Most newborns require only drying, warming, and stimulating to help them transition from
fetal respiration to newborn respiration. The resuscitation sequence can be remembered as
Dry, Warm, and Stimulate – Ventilate – Evaluate – and Resuscitate

5. Measuring the pulse oximetry on the right hand provides the most accurate oxygen saturation
(SpO2) in infants that are transitioning from fetal to normal circulation. At 60 seconds, 60% is
the target with an increase of 5% every minute until 5 minutes of life when pulse oximetry is
80–85%

6. Both hypoxia and excess oxygen administration can result in harm to the infant. If prolonged
oxygen use is required, titrate to maintain an SPO2 of 85–95%
7. While not ideal, a larger facemask than indicated for patient size may be used to provide BVM
ventilation if an appropriately sized mask is not available. Avoid pressure over the eyes as this
may result in bradycardia
8. Increase in heart rate is the most reliable indicator of effective resuscitative efforts
9. A multiple gestation delivery may require additional resources and/or clinicians
10. There is no evidence to support the routine practice of administering sodium bicarbonate for
the resuscitation of newborns
11. APGAR scoring is not critical during the resuscitation, although it may be prognostic after 20
minutes if the APGAR Score remains “0” despite resuscitation

Pertinent Assessment Findings
1. It is difficult to determine gestational age in the field – if there is any doubt as to viability,
resuscitation efforts should be initiated
2. Acrocyanosis, a blue discoloration of the distal extremities, is a common finding in the newly
born infant transitioning to extrauterine life – this must be differentiated from central
cyanosis

Version 3.0

a. Support the infant’s head as needed and apply gentle counterpressure to help prevent the
head from suddenly popping out
3. Check for nuchal cord (i.e., around the baby’s neck)
a. If present, slip it over the head
b. If unable to free the cord from the neck, double clamp the cord and cut between the
clamps
4. Do not routinely suction the infant’s airway (even with a bulb syringe) during delivery
5. Grasping the head with hand over the ears, gently guide head down to allow delivery of the
anterior shoulder
6. Gently guide the head up to allow delivery of the posterior shoulder
7. Slowly deliver the remainder of the infant
8. After 1 minute, clamp cord about 5–6 inches from the abdomen with two clamps; cut the cord
between the clamps
a. If resuscitation is needed, the baby can still benefit from a 1-minute delay in cord
clamping. Start resuscitation immediately after birth and then clamp and cut the cord at 1
minute
b. While cord is attached, take care to ensure the baby is not significantly higher positioned
than the mother to prevent blood from flowing backwards from baby to placenta
9. Dry, warm, and stimulate infant, wrap in towel and place on maternal chest unless
resuscitation needed
10. Resuscitation takes priority over recording APGAR scores. Record APGAR scores at 1 and 5
minutes once neonate is stabilized
11. After delivery of infant, suctioning (including suctioning with a bulb syringe) should be
reserved for infants who have obvious obstruction to the airway or require positive pressure
ventilation (follow Neonatal Resuscitation Guideline for further care of the infant) The
placenta will deliver spontaneously, often within 5–15 minutes after the infant is delivered
a. Do not force the placenta to deliver; do not pull on the umbilical cord
b. Contain all tissue in plastic bag and transport
12. After delivery, massaging the uterus (should be located at about the umbilicus) and allowing
the infant to nurse will promote uterine contraction and help control bleeding
a. Estimate maternal blood loss
b. Treat mother for hypovolemia as needed
13. Transport infant secured to mother with approved neonatal restraint system, in car seat or
isolette unless resuscitation is needed
14. Keep infant warm during transport
15. Most deliveries proceed without complications – If complications of delivery occur, apply high
flow oxygen to mother and expedite transport to the appropriate receiving facility. Maternal
resuscitation is critical for best fetal outcome. Contact medical direction and/or closest
appropriate receiving facility for direct medical oversight and to prepare the receiving team.
The following are recommendations for specific complications:
a. Shoulder dystocia – if delivery fails to progress after head delivers, quickly attempt the
following
i. Hyperflex mother’s hips to severe supine knee-chest position (i.e., McRoberts’
maneuver)
ii. Apply firm suprapubic pressure to attempt to dislodge shoulder. This often requires
two EMS clinicians to perform and allows for delivery in up to 75% of cases
iii. Attempt to angle baby’s head as posteriorly as possible but NEVER pull
________________________

iv. Continue with delivery as normal once the anterior shoulder is delivered
b. Prolapsed umbilical cord
i. Placed gloved hand into vagina and gently lift head/body off the cord
1. Assess for pulsations in cord, if no pulses are felt, lift the presenting part off the
cord
2. Wrap the prolapsed cord in moist sterile gauze
3. Maintain until relieved by hospital staff
ii. If previous techniques are not successful, mother should be placed in prone kneechest position or extreme Trendelenburg with hips elevated
c. Breech birth
i. Place mother supine, allow the buttocks, feet, and trunk to deliver spontaneously,
then support the body while the head is delivered
ii. If needed, put the mother in a kneeling position which may assist in the delivery of the
newborn
iii. Assess for presence of prolapsed cord and treat as above
iv. If head fails to deliver, place gloved hand into vagina with fingers between infant’s
face and uterine wall to create an open airway. Place your index and ring fingers on
the baby’s cheeks forming a “V” taking care not to block the mouth and allowing the
chin to be tilted toward the chest flexing the neck
v. When delivering breech, you may need to rotate the baby’s trunk clockwise; or sweep
the legs from the vagina
vi. Once the legs are delivered support the body to avoid hyperextension of the head;
keep the fetus elevated off the umbilical cord
vii. NEVER pull on the body, especially a preterm or previable baby – just support the
baby’s body while mother pushes when she feels the urge to
d. The presentation of an arm or leg through the vagina is an indication for immediate
transport to hospital
e. Nuchal cord
i. After the head has been delivered, palpate the neck for a nuchal cord, if present, slip
over the head
ii. If the loop is too tight to slip over the head, attempt to slip the cord over the
shoulders and deliver the body through the loop
iii. The cord can be doubly clamped and cut between the clamps; the newborn should be
delivered promptly
f. Excessive bleeding during active labor may occur with placenta previa or placental
abruption
i. Obtain history from patient – known previa, recent pre-eclampsia symptoms,
hypertension history, recent trauma, drug use especially cocaine
ii. Placenta previa most likely will prevent delivery of infant vaginally
iii. Place large bore IV and administer IV fluids as indicated
iv. If available, transfusion or the administration of whole blood as indicated
v. C-Section most likely needed – transport emergently
g. Postpartum hemorrhage
i. Obtain history from patient – history of prenatal or delivery complications, recent
trauma, prescription anticoagulants, drug use especially cocaine
ii. Perform fundal massage

iii. Initiate IV fluid resuscitation and, if approved by medical direction, transfuse blood
products
iv. Consider administration of tranexamic acid (TXA)
v. Although recommended following all deliveries, if postpartum hemorrhage occurs
following delivery, consider administration of oxytocin
h. Maternal cardiac arrest
i. Apply manual pressure to displace uterus from midline
ii. Treat per the Cardiac Arrest Guideline (VF/VT/Asystole/PEA) for resuscitation care
(defibrillation and medications should be given for same indications and doses as if
non-pregnant patient)
iii. Transport as soon as possible if infant is estimated to be over 24 weeks gestation
(perimortem Cesarean section (also known as resuscitative hysterotomy) at receiving
facility is most successful if started within 5 minutes of maternal cardiac arrest)
Patient Safety Considerations
1. Supine Hypotension Syndrome:
a. If mother has hypotension before delivery, place patient in left lateral recumbent position
or manually displace gravid uterus to the left in supine position
b. Knee-chest position may create safety issues during rapid ambulance transport
2. Do not routinely suction the infant’s airway (even with a bulb syringe) during delivery
3. Newborns are very slippery, take care not to drop the infant
4. Dry, warm and stimulate all newborns to facilitate respirations and prevent hypothermia
5. Do not pull on the umbilical cord while the placenta is delivering
6. If possible, transport between deliveries if mother is expecting twins
Notes/Educational Pearls
1. OB assessment:
a. Length of pregnancy
b. Number of pregnancies
c. Number of viable births
d. Number of non-viable births
e. Due date (calculate gestational age in weeks)
i.
If unknown gestational age, rough estimated gestational age with palpation of the
uterine fundus at the umbilicus is 20 weeks
f. Last menstrual period
i.
Only ask for estimated last menstrual period (first day of last period) if patient has
not had prenatal care/ultrasound and does not know their due date.
g. Prenatal care
h. Number of expected babies (multiple gestations)
i. Drug use and maternal medication use
j. Any known pregnancy complications – hypertension, gestational diabetes, placenta
previa, premature labor, history of fetal demise, fetal anomalies/birth defects, etc.
k. Signs of imminent delivery (e.g., crowning, urge to push, urge to move bowels, mother
feels delivery is imminent)
l. Location where patient receives care (considered a preferred destination if time delay is
not an issue and based on local protocols)
2. Notify medical direction/receiving facility if:

i. Labetalol 20 mg IV over 2 minutes
1. May repeat every 10 minutes X 2 doses for persistent severe hypertension with
preeclampsia symptoms
2. Goal is to reduce MAP by 20–25% initially
3. Ensure that HR is greater than 60 BPM prior to administration
OR
ii. Hydralazine 5 mg IV

b. Patients in second or third trimester of pregnancy should be transported on left side or
with uterus manually displaced to left to ensure adequate uterine perfusion
Patient Safety Considerations
1. Magnesium toxicity (progression)
a. Hypotension followed by
b. Loss of deep tendon reflexes followed by
c. Somnolence, slurred speech followed by
d. Respiratory paralysis followed by

4. Although less frequent, eclampsia, including eclampsia-related seizures, can occur in
postpartum patients
Pertinent Assessment Findings
1. Vital signs assessment with repeat blood pressure monitoring before and after treatment
2. Assessment of deep tendon reflexes after magnesium therapy
3. Examination for end organ involvement
4. Evaluate fundal height

Airway Management
Patient Care Goals
1. Maintain a patent airway
2. Provide effective oxygenation and adequate ventilation using the least invasive possible
method to achieve those goals paired with pulse oximetry and end-tidal capnography (EtCO2)
data
3. Anticipate, recognize, and alleviate respiratory distress
4. Provide necessary interventions quickly and safely to patients with the need for respiratory
support
5. Anticipate, identify, and plan for a potentially difficult airway
6. Optimize the patient for any advanced airway attempts
Patient Presentation
Inclusion Criteria
1. Patients with signs of severe respiratory distress/respiratory failure
2. Patients with evidence of hypoxemia or hypoventilation with medical or traumatic etiology
3. Patients with tracheostomies (See Tracheostomy Management Guideline)
4. Patients with acute foreign body airway obstruction
Exclusion Criteria
1. Chronically ventilated patients
2. Newborn patients
Patient Management

Cough
Skin color (cyanosis or pallor), presence of diaphoresis
Mental status, including anxiety
Airway obstruction with foreign body or swelling (e.g., angioedema, posterior pharyngeal
and laryngeal infections)
j. Signs of a difficult airway (short jaw or limited jaw thrust or mobility, small thyromental
space, upper airway obstruction, large tongue, obesity, large tonsils, large neck,
craniofacial abnormalities, excessive facial hair, tracheostomyscar or evidence of other
neck/facial surgery, trismus)
k. Signs of fluid overload (e.g., ascites, peripheral edema)
l. Traumatic injuries impairing upper and lower airway anatomy and physiology:
i. Facial injuries
ii. High spine injury (affecting phrenic nerve/intercostals)
iii. Neck injury (expanding hematoma, tracheal injury)
iv. Chest wall injury (bruising), including rib and sternal fracture, paradoxical chest
motion, subcutaneous air, sucking chest wound
Monitoring
1. Patients with significant respiratory distress should have continuous pulse oximetry and
waveform capnography monitoring for both assessment and for guiding therapy
2. Pulse oximetry is indicated to assess oxygenation
3. Quantitative waveform capnography:
a. Is indicated:
i. For assessment and monitoring of ventilatory status in patients with significant
respiratory distress, with or without airway adjuncts
ii. To assist in decision-making for patients with respiratory difficulty of unclear cause
(e.g., bronchospasm vs. pulmonary edema) and to help direct therapy
iii. To evaluate acid-base status in critically ill patients
b. Is not indicated for every patient with shortness of breath. Rather, it is a monitoring and
decision-making tool for patients with significant respiratory distress where interpretation
of the capnography waveform and EtCO2 values assist in determining the appropriate
course of treatment for the patient as well as the patient’s response
Treatment and Interventions
1. Generally, the approach is to implement the interventions below in an escalating fashion to
meet the patient care goals above
2. Administer oxygen if needed for air hunger or respiratory distress and titrate to a target SPO2
of 94–98%. Depending on patient presentation, this may be accomplished with nasal cannula,
nonrebreather, BVM, NIV
a. Even in apneic patients, starting passive oxygenation while escalating interventions are
implemented may be useful
b. During CPR, maximal oxygen supplementation should be provided
c. Consider humidified oxygen for patients with tracheostomy (See Tracheostomy
Management Guideline)
3. Open and maintain patent airway. If needed,
a. Provide head tilt/chin lift, or jaw thrust if concern for potential spinal injury

Version 3.0

b. Suction airway: for significantly contaminated airways, consider utilizing a suction assisted
laryngeal airway decontamination (SALAD) technique
c. Oropharyngeal airways (OPA) or nasopharyngeal airways (NPA) can be placed if needed to
maintain a patent airway and make BVM ventilation more effective
i. OPA are used for patients without gag reflex
ii. NPA are used for patients with gag reflex
d. Patient positioning can significantly impact respiratory mechanics. Patients with severe
bronchospasm should be left in the position of comfort (perhaps tripod) whenever
possible. Elevating the head or padding (shoulders, occiput) can assist with opening airway
and respiratory mechanics. This can both improve the ability to ventilate and limit
aspiration
e. For patients with tracheostomy in respiratory distress, see Tracheostomy Management
Guideline
4. Use bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation in the setting of respiratory failure or arrest.
Whenever possible, the patient’s head should be elevated up to 30 degrees
a. Two-person, two-thumbs-up BVM ventilation is preferred
b. PEEP should be used with BVM
i. 5 cmH20 is generally an appropriate initial PEEP setting
ii. Increase PEEP in stepwise fashion (2–3 cmH20 at a time) as necessary, allowing
time for the patient to equilibrate with each change before further adjustments
are made. The goal is to reach the lowest PEEP needed to adequately ventilate
the patient. Higher PEEP results in greater negative hemodynamic impact.
Generally, physician consultation should be considered for higher PEEP levels
(greater than 10–15 cmH20)
c. Continuous wave-form capnography monitoring should be placed in line
i. In patients without primary pulmonary pathology (i.e., acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS), COPD), maintain EtCO2 of no less than 35 and up to 40
mmHg. Patients with specific disease processes such as acute acid-base
disorders (i.e., DKA, lactic acidosis due to severe sepsis or trauma), acute
respiratory failure due to primary pulmonary pathology, or post-cardiac arrest
will have different EtCO2 parameters due to their underlying disease
ii. In patients with severe head injury with signs of herniation (unilateral dilated
pupil or decerebrate posturing), modest hyperventilation to EtCO2 no less than
30 mmHg may be considered for a brief time
d. Tidal volume:
i. Ventilate with just enough volume to see chest rise, approximately 6–8 mL/kg
ideal body weight
ii. Over-inflation (e.g., excessive tidal volume) and overventilation (e.g., excessive
minute ventilation) are both undesirable and potentially harmful
e. Rate
i. Adult: 10–12 breaths/minute
ii. Child: 20–30 breaths/minute
iii. Infant: 20–30 breaths/minute
f. Continuously monitor EtCO2 to guide tidal volume and minute ventilation
5. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) should be considered early for severe respiratory distress or
impending respiratory failure

Version 3.0

a. NIV options include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilevel positive airway
pressure (BiPAP), bilevel nasal CPAP, and high flow oxygen by nasal cannula (HFNC)
b. NIV can also be used to improve oxygenation pre-intubation in some patients with
respiratory failure
6. Supraglottic airways (SGA): Consider the use of an appropriately sized SGA if BVM (with
OPA/NPA) alone is not effective in maintaining oxygenation and/or ventilation. This is
especially important in children as prehospital endotracheal intubation is an infrequently
performed skill in this age group and has not been shown to improve outcomes over
prehospital BVM or SGA
7. Endotracheal intubation
a. When less-invasive methods (two-person BVM, SGA placement) are ineffective or
inappropriate, consider endotracheal intubation to maintain oxygenation and/or
ventilation. Other indications may include potential airway obstruction, severe inhalation
burns, multiple traumatic injuries, altered mental status with loss of normal protective
airway reflexes
b. Optimize patient for first-pass success with pre-procedure resuscitation, preoxygenation,
positioning, sedatives and paralytics as indicated by patient presentation
i. A bougie may be a helpful adjunct to successful airway placement, especially when
video laryngoscopy is unavailable and the glottic opening is difficult to visualize with
direct laryngoscopy
ii. For experienced EMS clinicians, video laryngoscopy may enhance intubation success
rates and should be used when available
c. Monitor clinical signs, pulse oximetry, cardiac rhythm, blood pressure, and waveform
capnography for the intubated patient
d. For adults, the largest tube size possible should be placed in the patient to limit difficulty
with mechanical ventilation and high airway pressures. Absent significant airway swelling
or underlying anatomic abnormalities, initial tube size (internal diameter in millimeters)
for adult females should be 7.5, adult males 8.0. For pediatrics, cuffed tubes are now
recommended
8. Post-intubation management
a. Inflate endotracheal tube cuff with minimum air to seal airway. An ETT cuff
manometer can be used to measure and adjust the ETT cuff pressure to the
recommended 20 cmH20 pressure
b. Confirm placement of advanced airway (endotracheal tube, SGA) with waveform
capnography (most reliable), absent gastric sounds, and bilateral breath sounds
c. Secure tube manually. Once proper position is confirmed, secure the tube with
tape, twill, or commercial device
i. Note measurement of tube at incisors or gum line and assess frequently for tube
movement/displacement using continuous waveform capnography and visual
inspection
ii. Cervical collar and/or cervical immobilization device may help reduce neck movement
and risk of tube displacement
d. Continuously monitor correct airway placement with waveform capnography during
treatment and transport, paying particular attention to reassessing after each
patient movement
e. Manual ventilation (see above for rate and tidal volume guidance)
f. Mechanical ventilation should be considered following advanced airway placement

if available. See Mechanical Ventilation (Invasive) Guideline.
g. Intubated patients should be provided appropriate sedation with sedative or opioid
medications, and sedation titrated to an appropriate target level using RASS score
or similar scale
h. Consider PEEP adjustment to achieve oxygenation and ventilation goals (see above)
9. Gastric decompression can improve oxygenation and ventilation, so it should be
strongly considered in any patient with an advanced airway and positive pressure
ventilation
10. When patients cannot be oxygenated/ventilated effectively using the above
interventions, or when conventional airway approaches are impossible, surgical airway
management is a reasonable option if the clinician has competency in the procedure
and risk of death for not escalating airway management seems to outweigh the risk of a
procedural complication
11. Transport to the closest appropriate hospital for airway stabilization when respiratory
failure cannot be successfully managed in the prehospital setting
Patient Safety Considerations
1. Suctioning to limit aspiration is a priority, since it is associated with development of hospital
acquired pneumonia and related increases in ICU stay and mortality.
2. Avoid excessive pressures or tidal volumes during BVM ventilation. The goal is to avoid
barotrauma as well as overventilation and related reduction of venous return/preload/cardiac
output.
3. Routine use of sedation is not recommended for treatment of anxiety in patients on NIV.
Anxiety should be presumed due to hypoxia or inadequate minute ventilation and treated
primarily with ventilatory support.
4. Endotracheal intubation should only be used if less invasive methods do not meet patient care
goals.
5. Once a successful SGA placement or intubation has been performed, obstruction or
displacement of the tube can have further negative effects on patient outcome. Tubes should
be secured with either a commercial tube holder or tape.
6. Meticulous attention should be paid to avoiding hypoxia and hypotension during intubation
attempts to limit patient morbidity and mortality.
7. Waveform capnography should be placed prior to the first breath through an invasive airway
to confirm placement.
8. Drug Assisted Airway Management (DAAM) should be reserved for specialized clinicians on
operating within a comprehensive program with adequate resources, ongoing training and
quality assurance measures, and close EMS physician oversight.
9. Once initiated and patient is tolerating mask, DO NOT discontinue CPAP/BiPAP until patient is
on the emergency department stretcher and hospital CPAP/BiPAP is immediately available for
patient to be switched over, or physician is at bedside and requesting CPAP/BiPAP be
discontinued. Breaking the mask seal causes a significant decrease in airway pressures and
may lead to abrupt decompensation due to atelectasis and alveolar collapse.
10. If patient deteriorates on CPAP/BiPAP (e.g., worsened mental status, increasing EtCO2,
vomiting), remove CPAP/BiPAP and escalate airway management options as above.
11. If an endotracheal tube becomes dislodged, SGA should be strongly considered.

12. Pediatric airway management requires appropriately sized tools and adjuncts based on
patient size/age. A method for determining appropriate sizing should be available to all EMS
clinicians.
a. Skill in BVM ventilation and NIV application should be emphasized in pediatrics.
b. SGA are reasonable primary and secondary adjuncts if needed.
c. Pediatric endotracheal intubation has unclear benefit in the prehospital setting.
d. Pediatric endotracheal tube placement and maintenance requires significant training to
achieve and maintain competency.
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. Oxygen is a drug with an appropriate dose range and undesirable effects from both too much
and too little supplementation. Effective oxygenation meets the oxygen saturation (SpO2)
target set for that specific patient in the context of their acute and chronic medical
condition(s). Permissive hypoxia (SPO2 ≥ 90%) may be appropriate in patients with COPD or
other complex respiratory pathology
2. Adequate ventilation provides sufficient minute ventilation to meet the patient’s acute
respiratory and metabolic needs and is generally titrated to an EtCO2 goal
3. Paramedics are less likely to attempt endotracheal intubation in children than adults with
cardiac arrest and are more likely to be unsuccessful when intubating children. Complications
such as malposition of the ET tube or aspiration can be nearly three times as common in
children as compared to adults
4. Continuous waveform capnography is an important adjunct in the monitoring of patients with
respiratory distress, respiratory failure, and those treated with positive pressure ventilation. It
should be used as the standard to confirm placement of all advanced airways. It can also be
helpful in the respiratory distress patient without an invasive airway to assess for causes of
respiratory distress, adequacy of ventilation, progression toward respiratory failure,
monitoring of BVM ventilation, as well as numerous other applications that provide insight
into acute metabolic and infectious disease processes. Continuous waveform capnography:
a. Should be used for patients with invasive airways for
i. initial verification of correct airway placement
ii. continuous evidence of correct tube placement
iii. to adjust ventilatory rate
1. to maintain EtCO2 35–45 in most patients
2. to appropriately but not excessively hyperventilate patients with signs of
herniation only to maintain EtCO2 30–35 (no lower than 30)
3. to gradually decrease EtCO2 in chronically and acutely severely hypercarbic
patients including post-arrest
b. Is strongly encouraged in patients in cardiac arrest
i. to monitor quality of CPR
ii. as an early indicator of ROSC (rapid increase of 10–15 in EtCO2)
iii. to assist in evaluating prognosis for survival
c. Should be used in spontaneously breathing patients who are:
i. on NIV
ii. in severe respiratory distress (e.g., receiving epinephrine, magnesium therapy)
d. In spontaneously breathing patients, waveform capnography can help with assessment of
critically ill patients, for example:

i.

assessment of adequacy of ventilation and change in ventilatory status in response to
treatment
ii. differentiating between severe bronchospasm (shark fin waveform) and other causes
of respiratory distress (normal waveform, pulmonary edema)
iii. hypotension due to sepsis or unclear cause (metabolic acidosis with/without
compensatory respiratory alkalosis)
iv. status epilepticus to evaluate ventilatory and acid/base status
v. evaluation for acidosis in patients with altered mental status and potential diabetic
ketoacidosis (metabolic acidosis)
5. Bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation (for cardiac arrest patients see Cardiac Arrest Guideline):
a. Appropriately sized masks should completely cover the nose and mouth and maintain an
effective seal around the cheeks and chin
b. Ventilations should be delivered with only sufficient volume to achieve chest rise.
Overventilation is undesirable
i. In children, ventilating breaths should be delivered over one second, with a two
second pause between breaths
c. Ventilation rate:
i. Adult
1. Support spontaneous respirations if the patient is hypoventilating
2. For apnea, provide one breath every 6 seconds adjusting based on pulse oximetry
and digital capnometry or capnography (with the goal of 35–45 mmHg)
ii. Pediatric – infant/child
1. Support spontaneous respirations if the patient is hypoventilating
2. For apnea, provide 1 breath every 2–3 seconds adjusting based on pulse
oximetry and digital capnometry or capnography (with the goal of 35–45 mmHg)
6. PEEP improves oxygenation or decreases risk of developing hypoxemia, by increasing
functional residual capacity (FRC), and tidal ventilation and may assist in meeting airway goals
by decreasing intrapulmonary shunting of blood and better matching perfused lung to
ventilated lung tissue, thus improving arterial oxygenation. It does not open fully collapsed
alveoli but re-expands partially collapsed ones. It does not decrease extravascular lung water
but redistributes it
a. Higher levels of PEEP are particularly useful in patients with acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS)
b. PEEP should be increased slowly by 2–3 cmH20 from 5 cmH20 to a max of 15 cmH20 closely
monitoring response and vital sign changes
c. Excessive PEEP over distends alveoli, increases dead space and work of breathing, reduces
lung compliance, and compresses alveolar capillaries, reducing oxygenation and risking
pulmonary barotrauma
d. Increased intrathoracic pressure can progressively decrease cardiac output and is most
notable when PEEP is greater than 15 cmH20. The higher the level of PEEP (over 5 cmH20),
the more likely the patient will experience a variety of adverse consequences, both
ventilatory and hemodynamic
7. Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) (e.g., CPAP or BiPAP):
a. NIV goals of therapy will vary based on patient presentation and history. More support
than is needed to relieve symptoms or “normal” is not necessarily better in these patients.
Goals of care may include:
i. Decreased air hunger
________________________

Version 3.0

ii. SPO2 of ≥ 94%. Chronic COPD patients tolerate hypoxia better, and an SPO2 of 90%
may relieve their symptoms and be adequate
iii. Normalization of respiratory rate (decreased tachypnea)
iv. Normalization of EtCO2. This means a downward trend in a patient with increased
EtCO2. Patients who have end stage COPD may have chronically elevated EtCO2 as high
as 50s–60s, and thus tolerate elevated EtCO2 better so normalization may not be a
good target
b. The key to successful use of NIV in a patient who has not used it before is coaching and
explanation of the process and reassurance of the patient
c. For any patient on NIV, focus on maintaining a continuous mask seal is essential to
maximizing the positive impact of PEEP, particularly at higher levels. Breaking the circuit or
removing the mask should be meticulously avoided, as the significant atelectasis will occur
which will take time to reverse
d. Nebulized medications may be administered through a CPAP or BiPAP mask. A specialized
T-connector with a spring valve assembly is required to allow maintenance of positive
airway pressure
8. Orotracheal/Endotracheal intubation (ETI)
a. Checklist use and use of protocolized interventions to optimize the patient physically and
physiologically have been shown to both improve success rates of orotracheal intubation
as well as decrease peri-intubation complications. Preparation should also include a
promptly available plan for alternate airway placement if ETI unsuccessful.

d. In addition to preoxygenation, apneic oxygenation (high-flow oxygen by nasal cannula)
may prolong the period before hypoxia during an intubation attempt
e. Positive pressure ventilation after intubation can decrease preload and subsequently lead
to hypotension
f. Significant attention should be paid to adequate preoxygenation to avoid peri-intubation
hypoxia and hypoxic cardiac arrest
g. Routine use of cricoid pressure is not recommended in pediatric or adult intubation
h. Prompt suctioning of soiled airways before intubation attempt may improve first pass
success and limit morbidity and mortality
i. Confirm successful placement with waveform capnography. Less optimal methods of
confirmation include bilateral chest rise, bilateral breath sounds, and maintenance of

adequate oxygenation. Color change on EtCO2 is less accurate than clinical assessment,
and wave-form capnography is superior. Misting observed in the tube is not a reliable
method of confirmation. Re-visualization with video laryngoscopy, when available, may
assist in confirming placement when unclear due to capnography failure or conflicting
information
j. Video laryngoscopy may be a useful tool for endotracheal intubation in the hands of a
practiced clinician
Manual vs. Mechanical ventilation: If mechanical ventilation is available, it is preferred to
manual ventilation due to the increased consistency of tidal volume and ventilatory rate, and
its ability to limit risk of overventilation. [See Mechanical Ventilation (Invasive) Guideline]
For patients being transferred from a hospital ventilator to a transport ventilator, the patient’s
current ventilator settings are generally a reasonable starting point if the patient is being
adequately oxygenated and ventilated based on pulse oximetry and capnography
Currently, there is limited experience with high-flow nasal cannula in the EMS environment, so
evidence-informed recommendations are not included in this guideline
Anxiety should be presumed due to hypoxia or inadequate minute ventilation and treated
primarily with ventilatory support. Routine use of sedation is not recommended for treatment
of anxiety in patients on NIV

Pertinent Assessment Findings
1. Ongoing assessment is critical when an airway device is in place.
2. Acute worsening of respiratory status or evidence of hypoxemia can be secondary to
displacement or obstruction of the airway device, pneumothorax, or equipment failure

assessment), temperature, and O2 saturation. Consider temperature and waveform
capnography
b. Air entry (normal vs. diminished, prolonged expiratory phase)
c. Breath sounds (wheezes, crackles, rales, rhonchi, diminished, clear)

iii. Intercostal/subcostal/supraclavicular retractions, accessory muscle use
iv. Grunting, stridor, inability to speak full sentences
v. Nasal flaring
vi. Cyanosis
Treatment and Interventions
1. Airway: See Airway Management Guideline for additional specifics
a. Give supplemental oxygen for dyspnea to a target of 94–98% saturation. Escalate from a
nasal cannula as needed to reach this goal
b. BVM ventilation should be utilized in children with respiratory failure
c. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) should be administered for severe respiratory distress via
BVM, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bi-level positive airway pressure
(BiPAP)
d. If indicated, bronchodilators should be administered in line with NIV
2. Monitoring
a. Pulse oximetry and EtCO2 should be routinely used as adjuncts to other forms of
monitoring in patients with respiratory complaints
b. Continuous cardiac monitoring may be indicated in patients with respiratory distress
associated with suspected acute or decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF) or
dysrhythmia
c. 12-lead EKG may be indicated to assess for dysrhythmia or ischemia, particularly in
patients with risk factors for coronary artery disease and/or presentation consistent with
CHF
3. IV Access and Fluids – IV access should be placed when IV medication administration is
indicated, or when there are clinical concerns of dehydration so that IV fluids can be
administered
4. Suspected bronchospasm, asthma, COPD:
a. Inhaled Medications
i. While albuterol 2.5 mg nebulized is usually sufficient for mild wheezing without
clinical distress, albuterol 5 mg nebulized (or 6 puffs metered dose inhaler) should be
administered to all patients in respiratory distress with signs of bronchospasm (e.g.,
known asthmatics, quiet wheezers). Repeat at this dose with unlimited frequency for
ongoing respiratory distress
ii. Ipratropium 0.5 mg nebulized should be given up to 3 doses in conjunction with
albuterol
b. Steroids should be administered in the prehospital setting
i. PO steroid options for patients not critical enough to require IV placement include:

Version 3.0

1. Dexamethasone (0.6 mg/kg, maximum dose of 16 mg) PO solution or IV solution
given PO, or
2. Prednisolone/prednisone (1 mg/kg, maximum dose 60 mg) PO
ii. IV steroid options for critically ill patients include:
1. Dexamethasone (0.6 mg/kg, maximum dose of 16 mg) IV/IM, or
2. Methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg, maximum dose 125 mg) IV/IM
iii. Other steroids at equivalent doses may be given as alternatives
c. Magnesium sulfate (40 mg/kg IV, maximum dose of 2 g) over 10–15 minutes should be
administered for severe bronchoconstriction and concern for impending respiratory
failure. Consider decreased dose of 1 g IV for geriatric patients
d. Epinephrine (0.01 mg/kg of 1 mg/mL solution IM, maximum dose of 0.3 mg) should only
be administered for impending respiratory failure as adjunctive therapy when there are
no clinical signs of improvement with the above treatments
5. Adults with suspected pulmonary edema due to acute heart failure or fluid overload (such as
dialysis noncompliance):
a. Restoration of adequate oxygenation and ventilation should precede or be accomplished
simultaneously with other medication therapies below
i. CPAP/BiPAP: See Airway Management Guideline for goals of care and escalation of
interventions
b. SBP less than 100 mmHg
i. IV fluid bolus 250–500 mL
ii. Consider vasopressor: Norepinephrine 0.02–2 mcg/kg/min
c. SBP less than 160 mmHg
i. Nitroglycerin
1. 0.4 mg SL, can repeat every 5 minutes for SBP greater than 100 mmHg
d. SBP >= 160 mmHg or MAP greater than 120
i. Nitroglycerin
1. 0.8 mg SL, can repeat every 5 minutes for SBP greater than 100 mmHg
2. Consider IV nitroglycerin infusion titrated to blood pressure
6. Suspected pulmonary edema due to other noncardiogenic causes (such as irritant inhalation,
abrupt opioid withdrawal). Provide supportive care to promote adequate oxygenation.
a. Inhaled Medications
i. While albuterol 2.5 mg nebulized is usually sufficient for mild wheezing without
clinical distress, albuterol 5 mg nebulized (or 6 puffs metered dose inhaler) should be
administered to patients in respiratory distress with signs of bronchospasm (e.g.,
known asthmatics, quiet wheezers). Repeat at this dose with unlimited frequency for
ongoing respiratory distress
ii. Ipratropium 0.5 mg nebulized should be given up to 3 doses in conjunction with
albuterol
Patient Safety Considerations
1. Normal EtCO2 (35–45 mmHg) with tachypnea and respiratory distress is an indicator of
impending respiratory failure
2. The use of nitrates should be avoided in any patient who has used a phosphodiesterase
inhibitor within the past 48 hours. Examples are sildenafil, vardenafil and tadalafil, which are
used for erectile dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension. Also avoid use in patients receiving
intravenous epoprostenol or treporstenil which are used for pulmonary hypertension

3. Invasive airways do not improve bronchospasm. The airway should be managed in the least
invasive way possible. Supraglottic devices and endotracheal intubation should be considered
only if BVM ventilation fails
4. Positive pressure ventilation in the setting of bronchoconstriction, either via a supraglottic
airway or intubation, increases the risk of air trapping which can lead to pneumothorax and
cardiovascular collapse. These interventions should be reserved for situations of respiratory
failure
5. The following medications should not be administered to manage bronchospasm as there is
no evidence of patient benefit:
i. Inhaled magnesium sulfate
ii. Heliox
Notes/Educational Pearls
1. The combination of ipratropium with albuterol may decrease the need for hospital admission
in certain patients
2. Magnesium sulfate may cause hypotension that will usually respond to a fluid bolus
3. Patient with acute heart failure and hypotension have high mortality
4. When assessing for cause of respiratory distress, CHF tends to be associated with lower levels
of EtCO2 compared to COPD. EtCO2 values that are extremely low and high are markers of
poor outcomes and need for intubation or ICU admission
Key Considerations
1. Nebulizer droplets can carry viral particles and other airborne pathogens, so additional PPE
should be considered, including placement of a surgical mask over the nebulizer (if feasible) to
limit droplet spread
2. Factors that have been shown to be associated with increased mortality from asthma include:
a. Severe asthma as evidenced by at least one of the following:
i. Prior near-fatal asthma (e.g., ICU admission or intubation/mechanical ventilation)
ii. Prior admissions for asthma or repeated ED visits, particularly if in the last year
iii. Heavy use of beta-agonist medications, or requiring three or more classes of asthma
medication
b. Together with one or more behavioral or psychosocial contributors:
i. Medication noncompliance
ii. Alcohol or drug abuse
iii. Obesity
iv. Psychosis, depression, other psychiatric illness, or major tranquilizer use
v. Employment or income difficulties
vi. Severe domestic, marital, or legal stressors
3. Single dose dexamethasone has been found equally effective as several days dosing of other
steroids, so dexamethasone is preferred over other po steroids
4. Acute heart failure is a common cause of pulmonary edema – other causes include:
a. Opioid overdose
b. High altitude exposure
c. Kidney failure or dialysis noncompliance
d. Lung damage caused by gases or severe infection

5. Nitroglycerin reduces left ventricular filling pressure primarily via venous dilation. At higher
doses the drug variably lowers systemic afterload and increases stroke volume and cardiac
output
6. Pulmonary edema is more commonly a problem of volume distribution than total body fluid
overload, so administration of diuretics such as furosemide provide no immediate benefit for
most patients and can cause significant harm. Inducement of inappropriate diuresis can lead
to increased morbidity and mortality in patients with other disease processes such as
pneumonia and sepsis
7. Nitrates provide both subjective and objective improvement, and might decrease intubation
rates, incidence of MIs, and mortality. High-dose nitrates can reduce both preload and
afterload and potentially increase cardiac output and blood pressure
8. If available and trained, ultrasound is useful to distinguish pulmonary edema from other
causes of respiratory distress (including pneumothorax)
9. Pulmonary edema due to irritant gas inhalation (i.e., chlorine) generally is best managed by
supportive care and escalation of airway interventions as above once the patient is
appropriately decontaminated. Early poison center consultation should be strongly considered
for guidance
10. Pulmonary edema due to high altitude should be managed as described in Altitude Illness
Guideline
Pertinent Assessment Findings
1. Severe respiratory distress may manifest with hypoxia, altered mentation, diaphoresis, or
inability to speak more than 2–3 words
2. In the setting of severe bronchoconstriction, wheezing may not be heard. Patients with known
asthma with severe dyspnea should be empirically treated, even if wheezing is absent
3. A “shark fin” on waveform capnography suggests significant bronchospasm and obstructive
physiology
4. Etiology of respiratory distress:
a. Bronchospastic etiology (e.g., asthma, COPD) is suggested by:
i. Wheezing on auscultation
ii. “Shark fin” waveform capnograph or prolonged expiratory phase
iii. History of asthma/COPD
b. Fluid overload etiology (e.g., CHF, pulmonary edema) is suggested by:
i. Jugular venous distention
ii. Rales on auscultation
iii. Peripheral edema
iv. History of CHF, diuretic therapy, dialysis noncompliance, hypertension

Mechanical Ventilation (Invasive)
Patient Care Goals
1. Maintain adequate oxygenation
2. Maintain adequate minute ventilation and capnography targets based on patient
pathophysiology
3. Prevent or limit risk of short- and long-term invasive airway and ventilator-associated
complications including barotrauma, pneumothorax, aspiration, over-ventilation
Patient Presentation
Inclusion Criteria
Adult patients with invasive airway requiring mechanical ventilation
Exclusion Criteria
1. Interfacility transfer patients with established vent settings
2. Patients with suspected untreated pneumothorax or large airway injury
3. Patients in cardiac arrest
Patient Management
Assessment
1. Confirm airway placement with ventilation and auscultation over epigastrium and assess for
symmetric bilateral lung sounds
2. Verify that airway (ETT, SGA) is securely held in place (by holder or other method)
3. Assess oxygen delivery and confirm that FiO2 meets patients' needs and maintains desired
oxygen saturation (SpO2)
a. If oxygen will be needed during transport calculate the duration of supply needed (O2 tank
time (min) = tank pressure (psi) x tank conversion factor/flow rate (L/min)
4. Assess blood pressure to assure SBP greater than 90 mmHg or resuscitate to SBP >=90 mmHg
or MAP >=60 mmHg
5. Assess mental status, level of consciousness, Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) or
similar sedation score
Treatment and Interventions
1. Set up ventilator and circuit, program initial ventilator settings as below. Suggested
general guidelines for adults with EMS initiation of mechanical ventilation:
a. Consider and modify based on any underlying acute or chronic lung pathology
(COPD, asthma, CHF)
b. Volume mode is generally preferred initially in adults
c. Select an appropriate ventilator mode: Assist Control (AC) is acceptable for most
patients

Initial settings:

Tidal volume

6–8 mL/kg ideal
body weight

Go to ARDSNET table of height and Predicted Body
Weight and Tidal volumes. Use 6–8 mL/kg as a
starting point. Patients with known acidosis should
start with 9 mL/kg

Respiratory rate

12–14 (or 8–12)
breaths/min

Adjust for target minute ventilation based on EtCO2

Inspiratory time

1 second

Adjust 0.7–1.2 seconds to maintain desired I:E ratio
(inspiration-expiration) ratio of 1:2 and patient
comfort

PEEP
FiO2
Sensitivity

5 cmH20
60%
-2 cmH20

Titrate to achieve target O2 saturation (94–98%)

ii. Set the heat moisture exchange (HME) at circuit Y.
iii. Plateau pressure (PPlat) goal is less than 30 cmH20
Patient Safety Considerations
1. Ventilators have different capabilities and features. Users must be familiar with the device they
use and must be properly educated on its use and application in the specific population being
treated
2. Ensure that all vent alarms are set appropriately, and patient is continually monitored with pulse
oximetry and waveform capnography
a. Set all alarms that involve high pressure, low pressure, minute volume, and apnea
b. Plateau pressure (PPlat) goal is less than 30 cmH20
c. Set high pressure alarm 10 cmH2O above resting PIP
d. Set low pressure alarm 5 cmH2O below resting PIP
e. Set low minute volume alarm 25% below resting minute volume
3. During transport of a critically ill patient only necessary adjustments should be made to the
ventilator. Focus on maintaining adequate oxygenation, minute volume and patient comfort.
4. An increase in the respiratory rate shortens the expiratory time. If changing rate, also check the I:E
ratio (the proportions of each breath cycle devoted to the inspiratory and expiratory phases) and
adjust the inspiratory time if necessary
5. The inspiratory time can be adjusted slightly to ensure greater patient comfort, however any
change in inspiratory time will affect the I:E ratio. Rarely should an inspiratory time be less than
0.7 for an adult
6. Assure proper sedation level for patient to tolerate ventilator
7. Assure patient does not have auto-PEEP
8. Asthmatics and patients with severe bronchoconstriction require different initial settings: for
example, PEEP of 0, FiO2 100%, tidal volume 5 mL/kg, rate 10, I:E of 1:4 – 1:6 to allow full
exhalation and limit breath stacking/auto-PEEP. Hemodynamic instability may indicate increased
intrathoracic pressure and require either manual chest wall compression to promote full
exhalation or possibly needle chest decompression for pneumothorax

Version 3.0

Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. It is important to understand the patient's underlying pulmonary status to choose the
appropriate type of ventilation (volume or pressure) and mode (AC or SIMV most common)
a. Volume control ventilation is generally preferred initially in adults with compliant
lungs (PPlat less than 30) because of better control of minute ventilation
b. Pressure control ventilation can be used in patients with non-compliant lungs and
elevated PPlat
c. Assist Control (AC) mode is acceptable for most patients and provides best control
of minute ventilation. Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (SIMV) is an
alternative option
Pertinent Assessment Findings
1. Perform a pre-ventilator use inspection including a circuit check on the ventilator prior to
placing it on a patient
2. Assess values during transport, including:
a. Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) Compare against baseline value to monitor for compliance
changes or obstruction in the circuit
b. Respiratory rate. Compare with baseline value, rapid increases could indicate leaks.
Overbreathing may require vent setting adjustment
c. Exhaled tidal volume. Compare against baseline, if extreme fluctuations, check for leaks in
circuit and in ET tube
d. Monitor the I:E ratio. 1:2 or 1:3 for normal lungs, longer E times may be needed for
patients with obstructive or restrictive lung disease
Quality Improvement

Key Documentation Elements
Documentation of ventilator settings and monitored values should include:
1. Ventilator Settings: Volume or pressure breaths; mode; respiratory rate; inspiratory time; tidal
volume or pressure, PEEP, FiO2; sensitivity
2. Patient Values (baseline and repeated): Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP); exhaled tidal volume;

Tracheostomy Management
Aliases
None
Patient Care Goals
1. Meet airway management goals in a patient with a tracheostomy
a. Assure patent airway, understand how to troubleshoot tracheostomy in a patient with
respiratory distress
b. Assure adequate oxygenation and ventilation
Patient Presentation
Inclusion Criteria
Any adult or pediatric patient with an existing tracheostomy greater than 7 days post placement
and a mature stoma tract
Exclusion Criteria
Adult or pediatric patient with tracheostomy less than 7 days post placement (i.e., no mature
stoma tract)
Patient Management
Assessment
1. Evaluate patient respiratory status as per Airway Management Guideline
2. In a patient with respiratory distress, evaluate for DOPE:
a. Dislodgement or misplaced tracheostomy (e.g., decannulation)
i. Assess for subcutaneous air in the neck which may indicate the tracheostomy is not in
the trachea
ii. Directly visualize the tracheostomy and the stoma (i.e., remove anything obstructing
direct view of stoma including clothing/bandages/sponges etc.) to assure it remains
properly seated in the stoma
b. Obstruction or secretions in tracheostomy
i. Assure tracheostomy is patent. Especially in pediatric tracheostomy patients with
significant respiratory distress, plugging or dislodgement/decannulation of the
tracheostomy is the problem until proven otherwise
ii. Auscultate breath sounds, consider potential for plugging of large airways in patients
with significant respiratory distress
c. Pneumothorax
d. Equipment connection problems
3. As with any patient with respiratory distress, appropriate monitoring with pulse oximetry and
waveform capnography should be provided as per Airway Management Guideline
Treatment and Troubleshooting Interventions
1. In patient with mild respiratory distress and adequate oxygenation:
a. Suctioning/clearing obstruction:

i.

If the patient is not on a ventilator, remove any cap, filter, or speaking valve that may
be connected to the tracheostomy
ii. Provide passive oxygenation with high flow oxygen over nose/mouth and stoma to
avoid hypoxia during procedure
iii. Remove inner cannula if present
iv. If needed, use 1–3 mL sterile saline directly into the tracheostomy to loosen
secretions and help clear obstruction
v. Pass appropriately sized suction catheter through tracheostomy
vi. Once obstruction is cleared, assist ventilations as needed with BVM to tracheostomy
tube, provide passive oxygenation or return patient to ventilator if patient on chronic
ventilator via tracheostomy
2. In patient with significant/severe respiratory distress and/or inadequate oxygenation:
a. If patient on ventilator, remove from vent and attempt BVM ventilation
b. Suctioning/clearing obstruction:
i. If the patient is not on a ventilator, remove any cap, filter, or speaking valve that may
be connected to the tracheostomy
ii. Provide passive oxygenation with high flow oxygen over nose/mouth and stoma to
avoid hypoxia during procedure
iii. Remove inner cannula if present
iv. Attempt to pass appropriately sized suction catheter through tracheostomy
v. If needed, use 1–3 mL sterile saline directly into the tracheostomy to loosen
secretions and help clear obstruction
vi. If suction catheter will not pass, the tracheostomy needs to be changed emergently
due to obstruction. (See below)
vii. Once obstruction is cleared, assist ventilations as needed with BVM to tracheostomy
tube, provide passive oxygenation or return patient to ventilator if patient on chronic
ventilator via tracheostomy tube
c. Emergent tracheostomy change: determine size of tracheostomy needed from imprint on
existing tracheostomy flange/collar. If no replacement tracheostomy is available, an
endotracheal tube of the same size or smaller may be used
i. Ventilate or provide passive oxygenation during procedure. Attempt to ventilate from
the upper airway or direct high flow O2 to stoma during attempts.
ii. Deflate cuff (if present)
iii. Remove ties and obstructed tracheostomy
iv. Immediately replace with new (lubricated) tracheostomy, remove obturator, and
begin BVM ventilation. Never use force. For difficult replacement, the following
strategies can be attempted:
a. Reposition patient with neck extended
b. Ensure proper lubrication and re-attempt approach at a 90-degree angle from
long axis of neck (i.e., from the side) to enter the stoma and then rotate back
along the long axis to complete insertion
c. Attempt reinsertion with a smaller sized tracheostomy or endotracheal tube
v. Confirm correct placement with waveform capnography, breath sounds, oxygen
saturation, chest rise
vi. Secure tracheostomy with tracheostomy ties or tube with appropriate holder
3. Consider use of humidified air or oxygen in any patient with a tracheostomy

4. Cuff may need to be inflated to provide adequate oxygenation and ventilation when positive
pressure ventilation is required. However, cuff should never be inflated if positive pressure
ventilation is not being performed, or in patients with a Passy-Muir (teal colored) speaking
valve in place
Patient Safety Considerations
1. Especially in pediatric tracheostomy patients with significant respiratory distress, plugging or
dislodgement of the tracheostomy is the problem until proven otherwise. Signs and symptoms
of respiratory distress, cyanosis, ventilator alarms sounding, decreased level of consciousness,
decreased SpO2 or cardiac arrest in patients with a tracheostomy, as well as bradycardia in
pediatric tracheostomy patients should be presumed due to a tracheostomy obstruction
2. Laryngectomy patients and some patients with congenital or surgical airway abnormalities
cannot be orally intubated. Patients with tracheostomy alone (e.g., for mechanical ventilation)
and no airway abnormalities should be able to be orally intubated
3. For recent tracheostomy patients who present with bleeding from the tracheostomy in the
early (up to 3 weeks) postoperative period, a tracheoinnominate arterial bleed is an
uncommon and life-threatening complication (0.7% incidence and a 90% mortality rate)
a. 50% of these patients present initially with a smaller sentinel bleed/hemoptysis which
appears to have stopped
b. Inflation of the tracheostomy balloon to the maximum is a potential temporizing measure
until definitive care can be provided, even overinflation may be needed. If the
tracheostomy is uncuffed, it can be replaced with a cuffed endotracheal tube and the
balloon maximally inflated
c. Any patient in the early postoperative period (within a month of surgery) with hemoptysis
or bleeding from a tracheostomy should be transported for evaluation, even if bleeding
has stopped
4. Prompt tracheostomy replacement is important. Delays allow for narrowing of the stoma and
can make recannulation more difficult
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. Tracheostomy tube components
a. Outer cannula: the tracheostomy size is stamped on the collar
b. Inner cannula: not found in all tracheostomies
i. Not commonly used in pediatric patients
ii. Removed by gently twisting a quarter turn to the left and pulling out
c. Balloon cuff: protects lower airway from secretions/blood from above, allows for better
mechanical ventilation
d. Collar: includes imprint of tube size and attachment for umbilical tape/tracheostomy ties
e. Obturator: stiffens and provides shape to tracheostomy tube to facilitate insertion. Must
be removed for ventilation
2. To determine the appropriate size suction catheter, double the size of the tracheostomy
(number on collar of tracheostomy tube)
3. A bougie may aid in the placement of an endotracheal tube into a mature stoma
4. An inner cannula may be required to ventilate through the tracheostomy tube

5. Uncuffed and fenestrated cuffed tracheostomy tubes may not protect the patient from
aspiration
6. If transporting a patient with a tracheostomy either in an emergency or routine transport, the
patients home tracheostomy equipment (e.g., “Go bag”) should accompany them. The
equipment that needs to be at the bedside to ensure safety includes appropriately sized
French suction catheters, operating suction system, and spare tracheostomy tubes. Sterile
saline, sterile gloves and water-soluble medical lubrication packets should also be available.
Most tracheostomy patients will maintain a kit with these supplies to travel with
7. Inadvertent tracheostomy decannulation incidence is the second most frequent lifethreatening pediatric tracheostomy complication, occurring at rates of 0.35–15%, with the
vast majority occurring more than 7 days postoperatively
8. Tracheostomy obstruction can occur for several reasons, including mucus plugging,
abnormal/excess granulation tissue, tracheomalacia causing collapse of the tracheal wall
around the tube
9. Do not replace a heat moisture exchange (HME) filter cap if soiled or wet as it can impede
airflow
Pertinent Assessment Findings
1. Adequate oxygenation without respiratory distress suggests that the tracheostomy is patent
and functioning correctly
2. Inadequate oxygenation and ventilation, respiratory distress, air hunger in a patient with a
tracheostomy should first be presumed to be due to tracheostomy obstruction
3. Neck or chest crepitus on palpation suggests tracheostomy misplacement outside the trachea

oral or other facial injuries. [See Airway Management Guideline]
3. Respiratory/Breathing
a. If absent or diminished breath sounds in a hypotensive trauma patient, especially those
with chest trauma and/or tracheal deviation, consider tension pneumothorax and perform
needle decompression of side without breath sounds or side opposite tracheal deviation;
may need second or third needle decompression on same side if there is a rush of air but
patient again has symptoms

Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. Optimal trauma care requires a structured approach to the patient emphasizing first control of
massive hemorrhage using MARCH (Massive hemorrhage, Airway, Respiratory/Breathing,
Circulation, Head injury/Hypothermia)
2. Target scene time less than 10 minutes for unstable patients or those likely to need surgical
intervention
3. Clinician training should include the ACS-COT 2022 National Guideline for the Field Triage of
Injured Patients
4. Frequent reassessment of the patient is important
a. If patient develops difficulty with ventilation, reassess breath sounds for development of
tension pneumothorax
b. If extremity hemorrhage is controlled with pressure dressing or tourniquet, reassess for
evidence of continued hemorrhage
c. If mental status declines, reassess ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) and repeat
neurologic status assessment [See Appendix VII. Neurologic Status Assessment]
5. Use structured communication tool for patient handoff to higher level care such as AT-MIST
a. Age
b. Time of incident or onset of symptoms
c. Mechanism
d. Injuries noted
e. Symptoms/Signs
f. Treatments provided
Traumatic Arrest: Withholding and Termination of Resuscitative Efforts
Resuscitative efforts should be withheld for trauma patients with the following:
1. Decapitation
2. Hemicorpectomy
3. Signs of rigor mortis or dependent lividity
4. Blunt trauma: apneic, pulseless, no organized cardiac activity on monitor
a. Note – Adult and Pediatric: Resuscitative efforts may be terminated in patients with
traumatic arrest who have no return of spontaneous circulation after 15–30 minutes of
resuscitative efforts, including airway management, evaluation/treatment for possible
tension pneumothorax, fluid bolus, and minimally interrupted CPR

b. Structural safety, possible toxic chemical contamination, the presence of poisonous
gasses, and other hazards might cause a delay in patient extraction
2. Remove patient from the scene as soon as is practical and safe
3. If the patient has sustained burns (thermal, chemical, or airway), consider transport to a
specialized burn center
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. Scene safety is of paramount importance when responding to an explosion or blast injury
2. Patients sustaining blast injury may sustain complex, multi-system injuries, including blunt and
penetrating trauma, shrapnel, barotrauma, burns, and toxic chemical exposure
3. Consideration of airway injury, particularly airway burns, should prompt early and aggressive
airway management
4. Minimize IV fluid resuscitation in patients without signs of shock. Consider injuries due to
barotrauma

Burns
Aliases
None noted
Patient Care Goals
Minimize tissue damage and patient morbidity from burns
Patient Presentation
1. Patient may present with:
a. Airway – stridor, hoarse voice
b. Mouth and nares – redness, blisters, soot, singed hairs
c. Breathing – rapid, shallow, wheezes, rales
d. Skin – Estimate Total Burn Surface Area (TBSA) and depth (partial vs. full thickness)
e. Associated trauma – blast, fall, assault
Inclusion Criteria
Patients sustaining thermal burns
Exclusion Criteria
Electrical, chemical, and radiation burns [See Toxins and Environmental Section]
Special Transport Considerations
1. Transport to most appropriate trauma center when there is airway or respiratory
involvement, or when significant trauma or blast injury is suspected
2. Consider air ambulance transportation for long transport times or airway management needs
beyond the scope of the responding ground medic
3. Consider transport directly to burn center if partial or full thickness burns (TBSA) greater than
10% and/or involvement of hands/feet, genitalia, face, and/or circumferential burns
Scene Management
1. Assure crew safety:
a. Power off
b. Electrical lines secure
c. Gas off
d. No secondary devices
e. Hazmat determinations made
f. Proper protective attire including breathing apparatus may be required
Patient Management
Assessment
1. Circumstances of event – Consider:
a. Related trauma in addition to the burns
b. Inhalation exposures such as carbon monoxide (CO) and cyanide (CN)
c. Pediatric or elder abuse

2. Follow ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) of resuscitation per the General Trauma
Management Guideline
3. If evidence of possible airway burn, consider aggressive airway management
4. Consider spinal precautions for those that qualify per the Spinal Care Guideline
5. Estimate TBSA burned and depth of burn
a. Use “Rule of 9’s” [See burn related tables in Appendix VI. Burn and Burn Fluid Charts]
b. First-degree/superficial burns (skin erythema only) are not included in TBSA calculations
6. Document pain scale
Treatments and Interventions
1. Stop the burning
a. Remove wet clothing (if not stuck to the patient)
b. Remove jewelry
c. Leave blisters intact
2. Minimize burn wound contamination
a. Cover burns with dry dressing or clean sheet
b. Do not apply gels or ointments
3. Monitor SPO2, EtCO2 and cardiac monitor
4. High flow supplemental oxygen for all burn patients rescued from an enclosed space
5. Establish IV access, avoid placement through burned skin
6. Evaluate respiratory status in patients with circumferential thoracic burns due to the risk for
ventilatory compromise and potential need for escharotomy
7. Evaluate distal circulation in circumferentially burned extremities due to increased risk of
circulatory compromise and potential need for escharotomy
8. Consider early management of pain and nausea/vomiting
9. Initiate fluid resuscitation – Use lactated Ringer’s or normal saline
a. If patient in shock:
i. Consider other cause, such as trauma or cyanide toxicity
ii. Administer IV fluid per the Shock Guideline
b. If patient not in shock:
i. Begin fluids based on estimated TBSA [See Appendix VI. Burn and Burn Fluid Charts as
appropriate to patient weight]
ii. Pediatric patients weighing less than 40 kg, use length-based tape for weight estimate
and follow
c. For persons over 40 kg, the initial fluid rate can also be calculated using the “Rule of 10”:
i. Calculate the TBSA (round to nearest 10%)
ii. Multiply TBSA x 10 = initial fluid rate (mL/hr) {for persons between 40–80 kg}
iii. Add 100 mL/hr for every 10 kg of body weight over 80 kg
10. Prevent systemic heat loss and keep the patient warm
Special Treatment Considerations
1. If blast mechanism, treat per the Blast Injury Guideline
2. Airway burns can rapidly lead to upper airway obstruction and respiratory failure. After
performing the appropriate airway management measures, the administration of nebulized
epinephrine, bronchodilators, nebulized n-acetylcystine, and nebulized heparin, if available,
can be considered to reduce edema of the laryngeal and pulmonary tissues and airway
occlusion from secretions and blood.

3. Have a high index of suspicion for cyanide poisoning in a patient with depressed GCS,
respiratory difficulty, and cardiovascular collapse in the setting of an enclosed-space fire. Give
the antidote (hydroxocobalamin), if available, in this circumstance
4. Particularly in enclosed-space fires, carbon monoxide toxicity is a consideration and pulse
oximetry may not be accurate [See Carbon Monoxide/Smoke Inhalation Guideline]
5. For specific chemical exposures (cyanide, hydrofluoric acid, other acids, and alkali) [See
Topical Chemical Burn Guideline]
6. Consider decontamination and notification of receiving facility of potentially contaminated
patient (e.g., methamphetamine (meth) lab incident)
7. Burns that involve significant sloughing or loss of skin can result in uncontrolled heat loss.
These patients should be monitored closely for the development of hypothermia and
appropriate preventative measures should be taken
Notes/Educational Pearls
1. Onset of stridor and change in voice are sentinel signs of potentially significant airway burns,
which may rapidly lead to airway obstruction or respiratory failure.
2. If the patient is in shock within one hour of burn, it is not from the burn. Evaluate the patient
carefully for associated trauma or cyanide toxicity.
3. If the patient is not in shock, the fluid rates recommended above will adequately maintain
patient’s fluid volume.
4. Pain management is critical in acute burns.
5. End-tidal capnography (EtCO2) monitoring may be particularly useful to monitor respiratory
status in patients receiving significant doses of narcotic pain medication.
6. Cardiac monitor is important in electrical burns and chemical inhalations.
7. TBSA is calculated only based on percent of second- and third-degree burns – First
degree/superficial burns are not included in this calculation
Quality Improvement
Burn trauma is relatively uncommon. Clinicians should receive regular training on burn assessment and
management.

Aliases
Compartment syndrome

Crush

Patient Care Goals
1. Recognizing traumatic crush injury mechanism
2. Minimize systemic effects such as rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia, acute kidney injury
Patient Presentation
Inclusion criteria
Traumatic crush mechanism of injury
Non-traumatic injuries that may cause compartment syndrome include prolonged immobilization,
prolonged compression of the torso/limbs, electrical injury, or burns
Exclusion criteria
None noted
Patient Management
Assessment
1. Identify any severe hemorrhage
2. Assess airway, breathing, and circulation
3. Evaluate for possible concomitant injury (e.g., fractures, solid organ damage, or spinal injury)
4. Monitor for development of compartment syndrome (pain out of proportion to clinical exam,
tense swelling, pain with passive stretch, muscle weakness, absent pulses, parasthesias)
Treatment and Interventions
1. The treatment of crushed casualties should begin as soon as they are discovered
2. If severe hemorrhage is present, see Extremity Trauma/External Hemorrhage Management
Guideline
3. Establish IV access. IV fluids should be administered prior to releasing the crushed body part.
Administer 1000 mL normal saline (NS) bolus. Avoid lactated Ringer’s solution as it contains
potassium. Crush injury without adequate fluid resuscitation develops into crush syndrome
4. For significant crush injuries or prolonged entrapment of an extremity, consider sodium
bicarbonate 1 mEq/kg (maximum dose of 50 mEq) IV bolus over 5 minutes
5. Attach cardiac monitor. Obtain/interpret 12-lead EKG, if available. Carefully monitor for
dysrhythmias or signs of hyperkalemia before and immediately after release of pressure and
during transport (e.g., peaked T waves, wide QRS, lengthening QT interval, loss of P wave)
6. For pain control, consider analgesics [See Pain Management Guideline]
7. Consider the following post extrication
a. Continued resuscitation with normal saline (500–1000 mL/hr for adults, 10 mL/kg/hr for
children)
b. If EKG suggestive of hyperkalemia or if findings of hyperkalemia, administer IV fluids and
consider administration of:

i.

Calcium chloride – 1 gm IV/IO over 5 minutes, ensure IV patency and do not exceed 1
mL per minute (Pediatric: 10% 20 mg/kg, max 1 g, IV.IO over 5 minutes.
OR
ii. Calcium gluconate – 3 gm IV/IO over 5 minutes with constant cardiac monitoring
(Pediatric: 10% 50 mg/kg (0.5 mL/kg), max 2 gram, IV over 5 minutes
c. If not already administered, for significant crush injuries with EKG suggestive of
hyperkalemia, administer sodium bicarbonate 1 mEq/kg (max dose of 50 mEq) IV bolus
over 5 minutes
d. If EKG suggestive of hyperkalemia, consider albuterol 5 mg via small volume nebulizer (can
be repeated if no response is seen)
Patient Safety Considerations
Scene safety for both rescuers and patients are of paramount importance.
Notes/Educational Pearls
1. Causes of mortality in untreated crush syndrome:
a. Immediate
i. Severe head injury
ii. Traumatic asphyxia
iii. Torso injury with damage to intrathoracic or intra-abdominal organs
b. Early
i. Sudden release of a crushed extremity may result in reperfusion syndrome (acute
hypovolemia, electrolyte abnormalities, and subsequent lethal arrhythmia)
ii. Hyperkalemia (potassium is released from injured muscle cells)
iii. Hypovolemia/shock
c. Late
i. Acute kidney injury (from release of toxins from injured muscle cells)
ii. Coagulopathy and hemorrhage
iii. Sepsis
Key Considerations
1. Rapid extrication and evacuation to a definitive care facility (trauma center preferred)
2. A patient with a crush injury may initially present with very few signs and symptoms. Maintain
a high index of suspicion for any patient with a compressive mechanism of injury
3. A fatal medical complication of crush syndrome is hyperkalemia. Suspect hyperkalemia if Twaves become peaked, QRS becomes prolonged (greater than 0.12 seconds), absent P wave,
prolonged QTc, or sine wave. Continue fluid resuscitation through extrication and transfer to
hospital
Pertinent Assessment Findings
1. Mental status/Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)
2. Evaluation for fractures and potential compartment syndrome development (neurovascular
status of injured extremity)
3. Examination of spine
4. Evidence of additional trauma, potentially masked by with other painful injuries

Patient Care Goals
1. Minimize blood loss from extremity hemorrhage
2. Avoid hemorrhagic shock due to extremity hemorrhage
3. Minimize pain and further injury due to fractures, dislocations, or soft-tissue injuries
Patient Presentation
Inclusion Criteria [Refer to Crush Injury and Crush Syndrome Guideline]
1. Traumatic extremity hemorrhage (external hemorrhage) due to blunt or penetrating injury
2. Known or suspected extremity fractures or dislocations
Exclusion Criteria
None noted
Patient Management
Assessment
1. Assess degree of extremity/external bleeding/blood loss
2. Vascular status of extremity:
a. Pallor

4. Neurologic status of extremity:
a. Sensation to light touch
b. Distal movement of extremity
Treatments and Interventions
1. Manage bleeding:
a. Expose the wound and apply direct pressure to bleeding site, followed by a pressure
dressing
b. If direct pressure/pressure dressing is ineffective or impractical:
i. If the bleeding site is amenable to tourniquet placement, apply a commercial
tourniquet to extremity:
1. Tourniquet should be placed 2–3 inches proximal to wound, not over a joint, and
tightened until bleeding stops and distal pulse is eliminated
2. If bleeding continues, place a second tourniquet proximal to the first
3. For thigh wounds, consider placement of two tourniquets, side-by-side, and
tighten sequentially
c. Wound packing:
i. Indications: Groin/axillary (“junctional”) injury or any limb wound with persistent
bleeding despite direct pressure and/or application of commercial tourniquet(s)

ii. Materials: hemostatic gauze, regular gauze, or any available material
iii. Procedure: pack tightly and fully to the depth of the wound until bleeding stops (may
require significant packing for deep, large wounds), then apply direct pressure and/or
pressure dressing; do not remove packing to assess bleeding
1. Pack around (do not remove) bone fragments or foreign objects
d. Junctional tourniquets may be considered for groin or axillary wounds, if available
e. Consider tranexamic acid (TXA) for injury associated with hemorrhagic shock if within
three hours of injury
Manage pain [See Pain Management Guideline]
a. Pain management should be strongly considered for patients with tourniquets and
suspected fractures
b. Do not loosen tourniquet to relieve pain
Stabilize suspected fractures/dislocations:
a. Strongly consider pain management before attempting to move a suspected fracture
b. If distal vascular function is compromised, gently attempt to restore normal anatomic
position, and reassess perfusion status
c. Use splints as appropriate to limit movement of suspected fracture
d. Elevate extremity fractures above heart level whenever possible to limit swelling
e. Apply ice/cool packs to limit swelling in suspected fractures or soft tissue injury, but do
not apply ice directly to bare skin
f. Reassess distal neurovascular status after any manipulation or splinting of
fractures/dislocations
g. Dress open wounds associated with fractures with saline-moistened gauze
Remove wet or blood-soaked clothing and use measures to prevent heat loss
Remove jewelry and potentially constricting clothing from the injured limb
Do not remove impaled foreign bodies

Patient Safety Considerations
1. If improvised tourniquet has been placed by bystander, reassess, and consider placing
commercial tourniquet proximal to it
2. If tourniquet is placed:
a. Ensure that the tourniquet is sufficiently tight to occlude the distal pulse
b. Ensure that the tourniquet is well marked and visible, and that all subsequent clinicians
are aware of the presence of the tourniquet
c. Do not cover the tourniquet with clothing or dressings
3. Mark the time of tourniquet placement prominently on the patient and in the patient care
report
4. Without removing the tourniquet or dressing, reassess frequently for signs of ongoing or
renewed bleeding, such as:
a. Blood soaking through dressing
b. Bleeding distal to tourniquet
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. Tourniquets should be applied to bare skin, 2–3 inches proximal to the wound
2. Tourniquet should be reassessed at every stage of patient movement to ensure ongoing
hemorrhage control.

3. Survival is markedly improved when a tourniquet is placed before shock develops
4. Properly-applied tourniquets in conscious patients are painful – treat pain with analgesics, but
do not loosen a tourniquet to relieve discomfort
5. Arterial pressure points may not be effective in controlling hemorrhage; however, may help
slow bleeding while tourniquet is applied
6. Amputated body parts should be transported with patient for possible re-implantation
a. It should remain cool but dry
b. Place the amputated part in a plastic bag
c. Place the bag with the amputated part on ice in a second bag
d. Do not let the amputated part come into direct contact with the ice
7. Pediatric considerations:
a. External hemorrhage control to prevent shock is critical in infants and young children, due
to their relatively small blood volume
b. Most commercial tourniquets can be used effectively on children over 2 years of age
c. Stretch-wrap-tuck elastic-type tourniquets can be used on any age patient
d. Direct pressure and wound packing may be more suitable for infants and young children
e. Consult with local online medical direction regarding use of traction splints for femur
fractures in young children, to avoid risk of possible nerve damage

* Use of tourniquet for extremity hemorrhage is strongly recommended if sustained direct pressure
is ineffective or impractical; Use a commercially produced, windlass, pneumatic, or ratcheting
device, which has been demonstrated to occlude arterial flow and avoid narrow, elastic, or bungeetype devices; Utilize improvised tourniquets only if no commercial device is available; Do not
release a properly applied tourniquet until the patient reaches definitive care
# Apply a topical hemostatic agent, in combination with direct pressure, for wounds in anatomic
areas where tourniquets cannot be applied and sustained direct pressure alone is ineffective or
impractical; Only apply topical hemostatic agents in a gauze format that support wound packing;
Only utilize topical hemostatic agents which have been determined to be effective and safe in a
standardized laboratory injury model

2. Burn trauma [See Burns Guideline]
Patient Management
Assessment
1. Overall trauma assessment
2. ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) with particular focus on ability to keep airway patent
a. Stable midface
b. Stable mandible
c. Stable dentition (poorly anchored teeth require vigilance for possible aspiration)
3. Bleeding (which may be severe – epistaxis, oral trauma, facial lacerations)

5. Cervical spine pain or tenderness [See Spinal Care Guideline]
6. Mental status assessment for possible traumatic brain injury [See Head Injury Guideline]
7. Gross vision assessment
8. Dental avulsions
9. Any tissue or teeth avulsed should be collected, if possible
10. Specific re-examination geared toward airway and ability to ventilate adequately
Treatment and Interventions
1. Administer oxygen as appropriate with a target of achieving 94–98% saturation. Use EtCO2 to
help monitor for hypoventilation and apnea
2. IV access, as needed, for fluid or medication administration
3. Pain medication per the Pain Management Guideline
4. Avulsed tooth:
a. Avoid touching the root of the avulsed tooth. Do not wipe off tooth
b. Pick up at crown end. If dirty, rinse off under cold water for 10 seconds

a. Place eye shield for any significant eye trauma
b. If globe is avulsed or enucleated, do not put back into socket. Cover eye socket with moist
saline dressings and then place eye shield over it
6. Mandible unstable:
a. Expect patient cannot spit/swallow effectively and have suction readily available
b. Preferentially transport sitting up with emesis basin/suction available (in the absence of a
suspected spinal injury.) [See Spinal Care Guideline]
7. Epistaxis: squeeze nose (or have patient do so) for 10–15 minutes continuously
8. Nose/ear avulsion:
a. Recover tissue, if possible
b. Transport with tissue wrapped in dry sterile gauze in a plastic bag placed on ice
c. Severe ear and nose lacerations can be addressed with a protective moist sterile dressing
Patient Safety Considerations
1. Frequent reassessment of airway
2. Maintenance of a patent airway is the highest priority; therefore, conduct cervical spine
assessment for field clearance (per Spinal Care Guideline) to enable transport sitting up for
difficulty with bleeding, swallowing, or handling secretions
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. Airway may be compromised because of fractures or bleeding
2. Lost teeth not recovered on scene may be in the airway
3. After nasal fractures, epistaxis may be posterior and may not respond to direct pressure over
the nares with bleeding running down posterior pharynx, potentially compromising airway
4. Protect avulsed tissue and teeth
a. Avulsed teeth may be successfully re-implanted if done so in a very short period after
injury
b. Use moist sterile dressing for ear and nose cartilage
5. For penetrating eye injuries, do not remove foreign bodies. Splint in place. Cover uninjured
eye or ask patient to close eye to prevent conjugate movement of injured eye
6. Consider administration of antiemetics to prevent increases in intraocular pressure due to
nausea and vomiting in penetrating and blunt trauma to the eye [See Nausea - Vomiting
Guideline]
Pertinent Assessment Findings
1. Unstable facial fractures that can abruptly compromise airway
2. Loose teeth and retro-pharynx bleeding

Version 3.0

a. Administer high-flow oxygen via NRB (non-rebreather) as a precaution against
unanticipated deterioration
b. If patient unable to maintain airway, consider oral airway (nasal airway should not be used
with significant facial injury or possible basilar skull fracture)
c. BVM (bag-valve-mask) ventilation if high flow oxygen (HFO)/non-rebreather (NRB)
inadequate to maintain good airway and/or oxygenation
d. Place supraglottic airway or perform endotracheal intubation or if BVM ventilation
ineffective in maintaining oxygenation or if airway is continually compromised.
Endotracheal intubation (ETI)/supraglottic airway (SGA) should only be used in systems
that have continuous EtCO2 monitoring
2. Breathing:
a. For patients who cannot maintain adequate oxygenation with HFO/NRB, BVM ventilation
(15 years old or older: 10 breaths per minute; 2–14 years old: 20 breaths per minute; less
than 2 years old: 25 breaths per minute) with gentle manual bagging. Consider flowcontrolled bags and ventilation rate timers to help prevent hyper-/overventilation
b. SGA placement or ETI should only be performed if BVM ventilation fails to maintain
adequate oxygenation. With advanced airways, manage with a target EtCO2 of 40 (normal
range 35–45 mmHg)
c. Do not induce hypocapnia through hyper-/overventilation
3. Circulation:
a. Wound care
i. Control bleeding with direct pressure if no suspected open skull injury
ii. Moist sterile dressing to any potential open skull wound
iii. Cover an injured eye with moist saline dressing and place cup over it
b. Moderate/severe closed head injury
i. Blood pressure: avoid hypotension
1. Adult (age greater than 10 years): maintain SBP greater than or equal to 110
mmHg
2. Pediatric: maintain SBP:
a. Age less than 1 month: greater than 60 mmHg
b. Age 1–12 months: greater than 70 mmHg
c. Age 1–10 years: greater than 70 + 2x age in years
c. Closed head injury
i. Administer normal saline (NS)/lactated Ringer’s (LR) fluid boluses to maintain SBP
above threshold. Do not wait until after the patient is already hypotensive—prevent
hypotension
d. Do not delay transport to initiate IV access
4. Disability:
a. Evaluate for other causes of altered mental status — check blood glucose during transport
b. Spinal assessment and management, per Spinal Care Guideline
c. Perform and trend neurologic status assessment (GCS or AVPU scale)
i. Early signs of deterioration:
1. Confusion
2. Agitation
3. Drowsiness
4. Vomiting
5. Severe headache

d. Severe head injury – Elevate head of bed 30 degrees
5. Transport destination specific to head trauma
a. Preferential transport to highest level of care within trauma system:
i. GCS 3–13, P (pain) or U (unresponsive) on AVPU scale
ii. Penetrating head trauma
iii. Open or depressed skull fracture
Patient Safety Considerations
1. Do not hyperventilate patients: Maintain all patients in EtCO2 range of 35–45 mmHg
2. Assume concomitant cervical spine injury in patients with moderate/severe head injury
3. Geriatric Consideration: Elderly patients with ankylosing spondylitis or severe kyphosis should
be padded and immobilized in a position of comfort and may not tolerate a cervical collar
4. Pediatric Consideration: Children have disproportionately larger heads. When securing
pediatric patients to a spine board, the board should have a recess for the head, or the body
should be elevated approximately 1–2 cm to accommodate the larger head size and avoid
neck flexion when immobilized
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. Head injury severity guideline:
a. Mild: GCS 14–15/AVPU = (A)
b. Moderate: GCS 9–13/AVPU = (V)
c. Severe: GCS 3–8/AVPU = (P) or (U)
2. Important that clinicians be specifically trained in accurate neurologic status assessment [See
Appendix VII. Neurologic Status Assessment]
3. If endotracheal intubation or invasive airways are used, continuous waveform capnography is
required to document proper tube placement and assure proper ventilation rate and minute
volume (preventing both hyperventilation [too fast] and overventilation [too much])
4. Herniation is difficult to diagnose in the prehospital setting. Hyperventilation results in
vasoconstriction which further decreases blood flow to the brain and worsens the secondary
brain injury.
Pertinent Assessment Findings
1. Neurologic status assessment findings
2. Pupils
3. Trauma findings on physical exam

Aliases
None noted
Definitions
• Hot Zone/Direct Threat Zone: an area within the inner perimeter where active threat and
active hazards exists.
• Warm Zone/Indirect Threat Zone: an area within the inner perimeter where security and
safety measures are in place. This zone may have potential hazards, but no active hazards
exist.
Patient Care Goals
1. Assess scene
2. Mitigating further harm
3. Accomplish mission with minimal additional injuries
Patient Presentation
Inclusion Criteria
High threat environment – when greater than normal conditions exist that could cause threat to
clinician or patient
Exclusion Criteria
No significant threat exists to clinician or patient allowing for the performance of routine care
Patient Management
Assessment, Treatment, and Interventions
1. Hot Zone/Direct Threat care considerations:
a. Mitigate threat as able to minimize risk to patients and clinicians, move to a safer position
and recognize that threats are dynamic and may be ongoing, requiring continuous
assessment of threat
b. Defer in depth medical interventions if engaged in ongoing direct threat (e.g., active
shooter, unstable building collapse, improvised explosive device, hazardous material
threat)
c. Triage should be deferred to when no longer in a hot zone/direct threat care zone
d. Prioritization for extraction is based on resources available and the situation encountered
e. Encourage patients to provide self-first aid or instruct uninjured bystanders to provide aid
f. Consider hemorrhage control:
i. Tourniquet application is the primary “medical” intervention to be considered in Hot
Zone/Direct Threat Zone. Tourniquet choice should be guided by expected ability to
perform in the desired patient population (pediatrics)
ii. Consider instructing patient to apply direct pressure to the wound if no tourniquet
available (or application is not feasible)
iii. Consider quickly placing or directing patient to be placed in position to protect airway,
if not immediately moving patient

2. Warm Zone/Indirect Threat care considerations:
a. Maintain situational awareness
b. Ensure safety of both responders and patients by rendering equipment and environment
safe (firearms, vehicle ignition)
c. Conduct primary survey, per the General Trauma Management Guideline, and initiate
appropriate life-saving interventions
i. Hemorrhage control
1. Tourniquet
2. Wound packing if feasible
ii. Maintain airway and support ventilation [See Airway Management Guideline]
d. Maintain body temperature and prevent hypothermia
e. Do not delay patient extraction and evacuation for non-life-saving interventions
f. Consider establishing a casualty collection point if multiple patients are encountered
g. Unless in a fixed casualty collection point, triage in this phase of care should be limited to
the following categories:
i. Uninjured and/or capable of self-extraction
ii. Deceased/expectant
iii. All others
Patient Safety Considerations
1. Anticipate unique threats based on situation
2. During high threat situations, clinician safety should be considered in balancing the risks and
benefits of patient treatment
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. In high threat situations clinician and patient safety will need to be simultaneously considered
2. During high threat situations, an integrated response with other public safety entities may be
warranted
3. Risks taken and threats to responder safety must be weighed in relations to the expected
benefit to patient safety and outcome
4. During these situations, maintaining communications and incident management concepts may
be crucial to maximizing efficiency and mitigating dangers

injury
3. Minimize patient morbidity from the unnecessary use of immobilization devices
Patient Presentation
Inclusion criteria
Traumatic mechanism of injury
Exclusion criteria
None noted
Patient Management
Assessment
1. Assess the scene to determine the mechanism of injury
a. Mechanism alone should not determine if a patient requires spinal motion restriction –
however, mechanisms that have been associated with a higher risk of injury are:
i. Motor vehicle crashes (including automobiles, all-terrain vehicles, and snowmobiles)
ii. Axial loading injuries to the spine
iii. Falls greater than 10 feet
2. Assess the patient in the position found for findings associated with spine injury:
a. Mental status
b. Neurologic deficits
c. Spinal pain or tenderness
d. Any evidence of intoxication
e. Other severe injuries, particularly associated torso injuries
Treatment and Interventions
1. Place patient in cervical collar and initiate spinal motion restriction in adults if there are any of
the following:
a. Patient complains of midline neck or spine pain
b. Any midline neck or spinal tenderness with palpation
c. Any abnormal mental status (including extreme agitation)
d. Focal or neurologic deficit
e. Any evidence of alcohol or drug intoxication
f. Another severe or painful distracting injury
g. Torticollis in children

h. A communication barrier that prevents accurate assessment
i. If none of the above apply, patient may be managed without a cervical collar
Patients with penetrating injury to the neck should not be placed in a cervical collar or other
spinal precautions regardless of whether they are exhibiting neurologic symptoms or not.
Doing so can lead to delayed identification of injury or airway compromise and has been
associated with increased mortality
If extrication is required:
a. From a vehicle: After placing a cervical collar, if indicated, children in a booster seat and
adults should be allowed to self-extricate. For infants and toddlers already strapped in a
car seat with a built-in harness, extricate the child while strapped in his/her car seat
b. Other situations requiring extrication: A, preferably padded, long board may be used for
extrication, using the lift and slide (rather than a logroll) technique
Helmet removal
a. If a football helmet needs to be removed, it is recommended to remove the face mask
followed by manual removal (rather than the use of automated devices) of the helmet
while keeping the neck manually immobilized — occipital and shoulder padding should be
applied, as needed, with the patient in a supine position to maintain neutral cervical spine
positioning
b. Evidence is lacking to provide guidance about other types of helmet removal
Do not transport patients on rigid long boards unless the clinical situation warrants long board
use. An example of this may be facilitation of immobilization of multiple extremity injuries or
an unstable patient where removal of a board will delay transport and/or other treatment
priorities. In these situations, long boards should ideally be padded or have a vacuum mattress
applied to minimize secondary injury to the patient
Patients should be transported to the nearest appropriate facility, in accordance with the
American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (ACS COT) 2022 National Guideline for
the Field Triage of Injured Patients
Patients with severe kyphosis or ankylosing spondylitis may not tolerate a cervical collar.
These patients should be immobilized in a position of comfort using towel rolls or sandbags

Patient Safety Considerations
1. Be aware of potential airway compromise or aspiration in immobilized patient with
nausea/vomiting or with facial/oral bleeding
2. Excessively tight immobilization straps can limit chest excursion and cause hypoventilation
3. Prolonged immobilization on spine board can lead to ischemic pressure injuries to skin
4. Prolonged immobilization on spine board can be very uncomfortable for patient
5. Children are abdominal breathers therefore immobilization straps should go across chest and
pelvis and not across the abdomen
6. Children have disproportionately larger heads. When securing pediatric patients to a spine
board, the board should have a recess for the head or the body should be elevated
approximately 1–2 cm to accommodate the larger head size and avoid neck flexion when
immobilized
7. In an uncooperative patient, avoid interventions that may promote increased spinal
movement
8. The preferred position for all patients with spine management is flat and supine. There are
three circumstances under which raising the head of the bed to 30 degrees may be
considered:

Version 3.0

a. Respiratory distress
b. Suspected severe head trauma
c. Promotion of patient compliance
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. Evidence is lacking to support or to refute the use of manual stabilization prior to spinal
assessment in the setting of a possible traumatic injury when the patient is alert with
spontaneous head/neck movement. Clinicians should not manually stabilize these alerts and
spontaneously moving patients since patients with pain will self-limit movement and forcing
immobilization in this scenario may unnecessarily increase discomfort and anxiety
2. Certain populations with musculoskeletal instability may be predisposed to cervical spine
injury. However, evidence does not support or refute that these patients should be treated
differently than those who do not have these conditions. These patients should be treated
according to the Spinal Care Guideline like other patients without these conditions
3. Pediatric considerations:
a. Age alone should not be a factor in decision-making for prehospital spine care, yet the
patient’s ability to reliably be assessed at the extremes of age should be considered.
Communication barriers with infants/toddlers or elderly patients with dementia may
prevent the clinician from accurately assessing the patient
b. There is no evidence that children experience non-contiguous multilevel injuries. The
existing evidence suggests that the rate of contiguous multilevel injuries is exceedingly low
at 1%
c. Because of variation in head size to body ratio, consider additional padding under the
shoulders to avoid excessive cervical spine flexion
4. Spinal precautions should be considered a treatment or preventive therapy
5. Patients who are likely to benefit from immobilization should undergo this treatment
6. Patients who are not likely to benefit from immobilization, who have a low likelihood of spinal
injury, should not be immobilized
7. Ambulatory patients may be safely immobilized on gurney with cervical collar and straps and
will not generally require a spine board. The role for standing take downs is extremely limited,
e.g., extrication of a patient with a high likelihood of a spinal cord injury from a large body of
water. Ambulatory patients may have a collar applied and walked to the EMS gurney
8. Reserve long spine board use for the movement of patients whose injuries limit ambulation
and who meet criteria for the use of spinal precautions. Remove from the long board as soon
as is practical
Pertinent Assessment Findings
1. Mental status
2. Normal neurologic examination
3. Evidence of intoxication

Trauma Mass Casualty Incident
Aliases
Disaster
Mass casualty incident (MCI)
Trauma triage for multiple casualties overwhelming EMS resources
Patient Care Goals
1. Save life and limb for greatest number given resources available
2. Triage and transport most critical requiring immediate in-hospital care first
Patient Presentation
Inclusion Criteria
Trauma MCI overwhelming immediately available resources
Exclusion Criteria
Routine EMS response for non-MCI for trauma
Patient Management
Special circumstances may occur in any incident in which the resources of the emergency medical services
are overwhelmed by the number and severity of casualties.
Triage and Treat
1. Ensure scene safety for EMS clinicians
2. Senior EMS clinician rapidly assesses scene and assigns roles and responsibilities to EMS
personnel
3. Sort patients using a locally agreed upon MCI triage process such as SALT (Sort, Assess,
Lifesaving Interventions, Treatment/Transport), START/JUMP-START (Simple Triage and Rapid
Transport), MUCC (Model Uniform Core Criteria), etc.
4. Identify those in need of immediate life-saving intervention
5. Triage categories are recommended and should be guided by local protocols: immediate,
delayed, minimal, expectant, dead
6. Triage new patients as identified
7. Re-triage frequently for duration of MCI
8. Immediate life-saving interventions for immediate patients
a. Treat hemorrhage with tourniquets, direct pressure with assistance from other patients or
other devices
b. Ensure patent airway by opening airway and using rapid adjuncts
c. Decompress tension pneumothorax
d. Use autoinjector antidotes if needed
Transport
1. First transport immediate patients
a. Those requiring immediate in-hospital care for life and limb, particularly surgical care
(suspected torso hemorrhage, uncontrollable junctional or extremity hemorrhage)

b. Those with injuries temporized that required immediate transport (received airway
intervention, decompressed tension pneumothorax, effective tourniquets for extremity
hemorrhage or amputations)
2. Second, transport delayed patients
a. Continue to re-triage continuously
b. Continue life-saving interventions
c. Initiate urgent required therapy
3. Assess minimal patients for appropriate transport decision
Patient Safety Considerations
1. Ensure patients remain in safe area
2. Re-assess scene safety as incident progresses as needed
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. The most experienced EMS clinician should perform triage.
2. Another experienced EMS clinician should be assigned to immediate patient area and perform
life-saving interventions as well as continuous triage.
3. Prioritize patients within immediate group for transport.
4. If available, another EMS clinician should be assigned to delayed area and perform urgent
interventions if patient condition changes. Continuously triage and prioritize within the
delayed patient group for transport.
5. Patient triage category may change with subsequent triage. If need for up-triage occurs,
perform life-saving interventions, and move patient to appropriate triage area (delayed or
immediate).
6. EMS system leaders within a defined area should work collaboratively to agree upon a
common triage tool.
7. Evidence is limited on the highest performing triage tool. Available evidence suggests that the
SALT triage tool was most likely to correctly triage adult emergency department patients, but
all tested triage tools demonstrated relatively high rates of under triage.

c. Quantity of medication or toxin taken (safely collect all possible medications or
agents)
d. Alcohol or other intoxicant taken
11. If bringing in exposure agent, consider the threat to yourself and the destination facility
12. Obtain pertinent cardiovascular history and other prescribed medications
13. Check for needle marks, paraphernalia, bites, bottles, or evidence of agent
involved in exposure, self-inflicted injury, or trauma
14. Law enforcement should have checked for weapons and drugs, but you may need
to re- check
15. Obtain any other pertinent patient history
16. Perform remainder of physical examination
Treatment and Interventions
1. Assure a patent airway
2. Administer oxygen as appropriate with a target of achieving 94–98% saturation, and if
there is hypoventilation noted, support breathing
3. Initiate IV access for infusion of treatment medication and/or lactated Ringer's or
normal saline if indicated, and obtain blood samples if EMS management might
change based upon the value (e.g., glucose, lactate, cyanide)
4. Consider fluid bolus (20 mL/kg) if evidence of hypoperfusion
5. Administration of appropriate antidote or mitigating medication (refer to
specific agent guideline if not listed below)

a. Acetaminophen overdose:
i. Consider activated charcoal without sorbitol (1 g/kg) PO only if within the
first hour of ingestion and prolonged transport to definitive care
ii. Based on suspected quantity and timing, consider acetylcysteine (pediatric
and adult), if available
1. Loading dose is acetylcysteine 150 mg/kg IV; mix in 200 mL of dextrose
5% in water (D5W) and infuse over 1 hr
2. After loading dose, give acetylcysteine 50 mg/kg IV in 500 mL D5W over 4
hrs.
3. If IV is not available, acetylcysteine 140 mg/kg PO
iii. If risk of rapidly decreasing mental status, do not administer oral agents
b. Aspirin overdose:
i. Consider activated charcoal without sorbitol (1 gm/kg) PO only if within the first
hour of ingestion
1. As ASA is erratically absorbed, charcoal is highly recommended to be
administered early
2. If altered mental status or risk of rapid decreasing mental status from
polypharmacy, do not administer oral agents including activated
charcoal
ii. In salicylate poisonings, let the patient breathe on their own, even if
tachypneic, until there is evidence of decompensation or dropping oxygen
saturation. Acid/base disturbances and outcomes worsen when the patient
is manually ventilated
c. Benzodiazepine overdose:
i. Respiratory support
ii. Consider fluid challenge (20 mL/kg) for hypotension
iii. Consider vasopressors after adequate fluid resuscitation (1–2 liters of
crystalloid in adult) for the hypotensive patient
d. Caustic substances ingestion (i.e., acids and alkali):
i. Evaluate for airway compromise secondary to spasm or direct injury
associated with oropharyngeal burns
e. Dystonia (symptomatic), extrapyramidal signs or symptoms, or mild allergic reactions
i. Consider administration of diphenhydramine
1. Adult: diphenhydramine 25–50 mg IV or IM
2. Pediatric: diphenhydramine 1–1.25 mg/kg IVP/IO or IM (maximum
single dose of 25 mg)
f. Monoamine oxidase inhibitor overdose (symptomatic, e.g., MAOI;
isocarboxazid, phenelzine, selegiline, tranylcypromine)
i. Consider administration of midazolam for temperature control
ii. Adult and Pediatric: Midazolam 0.1 mg/kg in 2 mg increments slow IV push over
one to two minutes per increment with maximum single dose 5 mg — reduce
by 50% for patients 69 years old or older
g. Opiate overdose, treat per the Opioid Poisoning/Overdose Guideline
h. Oral ingestion unknown poisoning:
i. If there is a risk of rapidly decreasing mental status or for petroleumbased ingestions, do not administer oral agents
ii. Consider administration of activated charcoal without sorbitol (1 g/kg)

PO particularly if it is within the first 1 hour after ingestion (including
acetaminophen) and there will be prolonged transport to definitive
care.
iii. Patients who have ingested medications with extended release or
delayed absorption may also be administered activated charcoal
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRls)
i. Consider early airway management
ii. Treat arrhythmias following Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) guidelines
iii. Aggressively control hyperthermia with cooling measures
iv. Consider fluid challenge (20 mL/kg) for hypotension
v. Consider vasopressors after adequate fluid resuscitation (1–2 liters of
crystalloid in adult) for the hypotensive patient [See Shock Guideline ]
vi. For agitation, consider midazolam
1. Adult: midazolam 0.1 mg/kg in 2 mg increments slow IV push over one to
two minutes per increment with maximum single dose 5 mg
a. Reduce by 50% for patients 69 years or older
2. Pediatric: midazolam 0.1 mg/kg in 2 mg increments slow IV push over
one to two minutes per increment with maximum single dose 4 mg or
midazolam 0.2 mg/kg IN to maximum single dose of 10 mg
vii. For seizures, treat per Seizures Guideline
Tricyclic Antidepressant (TCA)/Sodium Channel Blocker Overdose:
i. Consider early airway management
ii. If widened QRS (100 msec or greater), consider sodium bicarbonate 1–2
mEq/kg IV, this can be repeated as needed to narrow QRS and improve blood
pressure
iii. Consider fluid challenge (20 mL/kg) for hypotension
iv. Consider vasopressors after adequate fluid resuscitation (1–2 liters of
crystalloid) for the hypotensive patient [See Shock Guideline]
v. For agitation, consider midazolam
1. Adult: midazolam 0.1 mg/kg in 2 mg increments slow IV push over one to
two minutes per increment with maximum single dose 5 mg
a. Reduce by 50% for patients 69 years or older
2. Pediatric: midazolam 0.1 mg/kg in 2 mg increments slow IV push over
one to two minutes per increment with maximum single dose 4 mg or
midazolam 0.2 mg/kg IN to maximum single dose of 10 mg
vi. For seizure, treat per Seizures Guideline

Patient Safety Considerations
1. Scene/environmental safety for patient and clinician
a. Consider environmental carbon monoxide monitor use
2. Monitor patient airway, breathing, pulse oximetry, EtCO2 for adequate ventilation as they may
change over time
3. Repeat vital signs often
4. Monitor level of consciousness
5. Monitor EKG with special attention to rate, rhythm, QRS and QT duration
6. Maintain or normalize patient temperature

7. The regional poison center should be engaged as early as reasonably possible to aid in
appropriate therapy and to track patient outcomes to improve knowledge of toxic effects. The
national 24-hour toll-free telephone number to poison control centers is (800) 222- 1222,
and it is a resource for free, confidential expert advice from anywhere in the United States
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. Each toxin or overdose has unique characteristics which must be considered in
individual protocols
2. Activated charcoal (which does not bind to all medications or agents) is still a useful
adjunct in the serious-agent, enterohepatic, or extended-release agent poisoning if the
patient does not have the potential for rapid alteration of mental status or
airway/aspiration risk. Precautions should be taken to avoid or reduce the risk of
aspiration
3. Ipecac is not recommended for any poisoning or toxic ingestion — the manufacturer
has stopped production of this medication
4. Flumazenil is not indicated in a suspected benzodiazepine overdose as it can precipitate
refractory/intractable seizures if the patient is a benzodiazepine dependent patient
Pertinent Assessment Findings
Frequent reassessment is essential as patient deterioration can be rapid and catastrophic
Quality Improvement
Associated NEMSIS Protocol(s) (eProtocol.01) (for additional information, go to www.nemsis.org)
• 9914135—General - Overdose/Poisoning/Toxic Ingestion
Key Documentation Elements
• Repeat evaluation and documentation of signs and symptoms as patient clinical conditions
may deteriorate rapidly
• Identification of possible etiology of poisoning
• Initiating measures on scene to prevent exposure of bystanders when appropriate/indicated
• Time of symptoms onset and time of initiation of exposure-specific treatments
Performance Measures
Early airway management in the rapidly deteriorating patient
Accurate exposure history
o Time of ingestion/exposure
o Route of exposure
o Quantity of medication or toxin taken (safely collect all possible mediations or agents)
o Alcohol or other intoxicant taken
• Appropriate protocol selection and management
• Multiple frequent documented reassessments

Patient Care Goals
1. Rapid recognition of the signs and symptoms of confirmed or suspected
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) agents such as carbamates, nerve agents, or
organophosphates exposure followed by expeditious and repeated administration
of atropine, the primary antidote
2. Carbamates and organophosphates are commonly active agents in commercial
insecticides
3. Accidental carbamate exposure rarely requires treatment
Patient Presentation
Inclusion Criteria
1. DUMBELS is a mnemonic used to describe the signs and symptoms of acetylcholinesterase
inhibitor agent poisoning. All patient age groups are included where the signs and symptoms
exhibited are consistent with the toxidrome of DUMBELS
a. Diarrhea

e. Emesis
f. Lacrimation
g. Salivation/Sweating
Exclusion Criteria
None noted
Patient Management
1. Don the appropriate PPE
2. Remove the patient's clothing and wash the skin with soap and warm water
a. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agents can be absorbed through the skin
b. Contaminated clothing can provide a source of continued exposure to the toxin
3. Rapidly assess the patient's respiratory status, mental status, and pupillary status
4. Administer the antidote atropine immediately for confirmed or suspected
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agent exposure
5. Administer oxygen as appropriate with a target of achieving 94–98% saturation and
provide airway management
6. Establish intravenous access (if possible)
7. Apply a cardiac monitor (if available)
8. The heart rate may be normal, bradycardic, or tachycardic

9. Clinical improvement should be based upon the drying of secretions and easing
of respiratory effort rather than heart rate or pupillary response
10. Continuous and ongoing patient reassessment is critical
Assessment
1. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agents are highly toxic chemical agents and can rapidly
be fatal
2. Patients with low-dose chronic exposures may have a more delayed presentation
of symptoms
3. Antidotes (atropine and pralidoxime) are effective if administered before circulation fails
4. The patient may develop:
a. Miosis (pinpoint pupils)
b. Bronchospasm
c. Bradycardia
d. Vomiting
e. Excessive secretions in the form of:
i. Tearing
ii. Salivation
iii. Rhinorrhea
iv. Diarrhea
v. Urination
vi. Bronchorrhea
5. Penetration of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agent into the central nervous system
(CNS) will cause:
a. Headache
b. Confusion
c. Generalized muscle weakness
d. Seizures
e. Lethargy or unresponsiveness
6. Estimated level of exposure based upon signs and symptoms
a. Mild
i. Miosis alone (while this is a primary sign in vapor exposure, it may not be
present is all exposures)
ii. Miosis and severe rhinorrhea
b. Mild to moderate (in addition to symptoms of mild exposure)
i. Localized swelling
ii. Muscle fasciculations
iii. Nausea and vomiting
iv. Weakness
v. Shortness of breath
c. Severe (in addition to symptoms of mild to moderate exposure)
i. Unconsciousness
ii. Convulsions
iii. Apnea or severe respiratory distress requiring assisted ventilation
iv. Flaccid paralysis
7. Onset of symptoms can be immediate with an exposure to a large amount of
the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor

Version 3.0

a. There is usually an asymptomatic interval of minutes after liquid exposure before
these symptoms occur
b. Effects from vapor exposure occur almost immediately
8. Signs and symptoms with large acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agent exposures (regardless
of route)
a. Sudden loss of consciousness
b. Seizures
c. Copious secretions
d. Apnea
e. Death
9. Obtain an accurate exposure history (as patient may become unconscious before arrival at
the ED:
a. Time of ingestion or exposure
b. Route of exposure
c. Quantity of medication or toxin taken (safely collect all possible medications or agents)
d. Alcohol or other intoxicant taken
e. Pertinent cardiovascular history or other prescribed medications for underlying disease
10. The patient can manifest any of the signs and symptoms of the toxidrome based on the
route of exposure, agent involved, and concentration of the agent:
a. Vapor exposures will have a direct effect on the eyes and pupils causing miosis
b. Patients with isolated skin exposures will have normally reactive pupils
c. Certain acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agents can place the patient at risk for both
a vapor and skin exposure
Treatment and Interventions (See dosing tables)
1. Medications:
a. Atropine
i. Atropine is the primary antidote for organophosphate, carbamate, or nerve
agent exposures, and repeated doses should be administered liberally to
patients who exhibit signs and symptoms of exposure or toxicity
ii. Atropine may be provided in multi-dose vials, pre-filled syringes, or autoinjectors
b. Pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM)
i. Pralidoxime chloride is a secondary treatment and should be given concurrently
to reactivate acetylcholinesterase
ii. Pralidoxime chloride may be provided in a single dose vial, pre-filled syringes, or
auto-injectors
iii. Auto-injectors typically contain 600 mg of pralidoxime chloride
iv. To be beneficial to the victim, a dose of pralidoxime chloride should be
administered shortly after the nerve agent or organophosphate poisoning as it
has minimal clinical effect if administration is delayed
c. Benzodiazepines
i. Benzodiazepines are administered as an anticonvulsant for those patients who
exhibit seizure activity [See Seizures Guideline for doses and routes of
administration]
ii. Lorazepam, diazepam, and midazolam are the most frequently used
benzodiazepines in the prehospital setting; midazolam may have the fastest

onset of action
iii. Benzodiazepines may be provided in multi-dose or single-dose vials, pre-filled
syringes, or auto-injectors
iv. CANA® (Convulsive Antidote Nerve Agent) is a commercially available autoinjector that contains 10 mg of diazepam
d. Duodote®
i. A commercially available auto-injector of nerve agent/organophosphate
antidote
ii. Duodote® is one auto-injector that contains 2.1 mg of atropine and 600 mg of
pralidoxime chloride
e. ATNAA® (Antidote Treatment Nerve Agent Auto-injector)
i. An auto-injector of nerve agent/organophosphate antidote that is typically in
military supplies
ii. ATNAA® is one auto-injector that contains 2.1 mg of atropine and 600 mg of
pralidoxime chloride
iii. ATNAA®may be seen in civilian supplies assets when Duodote® is unavailable or
in short supply
f. CHEMPACK
i. Federal cache of nerve agent antidotes that is managed by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and offered to states that voluntarily
agree to maintain custody and security of CHEMPACK assets
ii. These are forward-deployed at sites determined by states that are part of the
program such as hospitals and EMS centers
iii. Deployment of CHEMPACKs is reserved for events where the nerve
agent/organophosphate exposure will deplete the local or regional supply of
antidotes
iv. There are two types of CHEMPACK containers:
1. EMS Containers: CHEMPACK assets for EMS contain a large portion of autoinjectors for rapid administration of antidotes by EMS clinicians of all levels
of licensure/certification. They contain enough antidote to treat roughly
454 patients
2. Hospital Containers: CHEMPACK assets contain a large portion of multidose
vials and powders for reconstitution — they contain enough antidote to
treat roughly 1,000 patients
2. Medication Administration:
a. Atropine, in large and potentially multiple doses, is the antidote for an
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agent poisoning
b. Atropine should be administered immediately followed by repeated doses
until the patient' s secretions resolve
c. Pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM) is a secondary treatment and, when possible,
should be administered concurrently with atropine
d. The stock of atropine and pralidoxime chloride available to EMS clinicians is
usually not sufficient to fully treat the victim of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor
agent exposure; however, EMS clinicians should initiate the administration of
atropine and, if available, pralidoxime chloride
e. Seizures should be treated with benzodiazepines. There is some emerging
evidence that, for midazolam, the intranasal route of administration may be

Version 3.0

preferable to the intramuscular route. However, intramuscular absorption
may be more clinically efficacious than the intranasal route in the presence of
significant rhinorrhea
f. The patient should be emergently transported to the closest appropriate medical
facility as directed by medical direction
3. Recommended Doses (See dosing tables)
The medication dosing tables that are provided below are based upon the severity of
the clinical signs and symptoms exhibited by the patient. There are several imperative
factors to note:
a. For organophosphate or severe acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agent exposure, the
required dose of atropine necessary to dry secretions and improve the respiratory
status may exceed 20 mg. Atropine should be administered rapidly and repeatedly
until the patient's clinical symptoms diminish. Atropine must be given until the
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agent has been metabolized.
b. Because Duodote® auto-injectors contain pralidoxime chloride, they should not
be used for additional dosing of atropine beyond the recommended
administered dose of pralidoxime chloride
c. All the medications below can be administered intravenously in the same doses
cited for the intramuscular route. However, due to the rapidity of onset of signs,
symptoms, and potential death from acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agents,
intramuscular administration is highly recommended to eliminate the inherent
delay associated with establishing intravenous access
d. The antidotes can be administered via the intraosseous route. However, due to
the rapidity of onset of signs, symptoms, and potential death from
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agents, intramuscular administration remains the
preferable due to the inherent delay associated with establishing intraosseous
access and the limited use of this route of administration for other medications

pupillary response
4. Precautions for pralidoxime chloride administration:
a. Although Duodote® and ATNAA® contains atropine, the primary antidote for an
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agent poisoning, the inclusion of pralidoxime chloride in
the auto-injector can present challenges if additional doses of atropine are warranted
by the patient condition and other formulations of atropine are unavailable:
i. Pediatrics: an overdose of pralidoxime chloride may cause profound
neuromuscular weakness and subsequent respiratory depression
ii. Adults: Especially for the geriatric victim, excessive doses of pralidoxime
chloride may cause severe systolic and diastolic hypertension, neuromuscular
weakness, headache, tachycardia, and visual impairment
iii. Geriatrics: victim who may have underlying medical conditions, particularly
impaired kidney function or hypertension, the EMS clinician should consider
administering the lower recommended adult dose of intravenous pralidoxime
chloride
5. Considerations during the use of auto-injectors
a. If an auto-injector is administered, a dose calculation prior to administration is
not necessary
b. For atropine, additional auto-injectors should be administered until secretions diminish.
c. Mark 1 kits, Duodote® and ATNAA® have not been approved for pediatric use by the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA), but they can be considered for the initial treatment for
children of any age with severe symptoms of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agent
poisoning especially if other formulations of atropine are unavailable
d. Pediatric Atro-Pen® auto-injectors are commercially available in a 0.25 mg autoinjector (yellow) and a 0.5 mg auto-injector (red). Atro-Pen® auto-injectors are
commercially available in a 1 mg auto-injector (blue) and a 2 mg auto-injector (green)
e. A pralidoxime chloride 600 mg auto-injector may be administered to an infant
that weighs greater than 12 kg
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. Clinical effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agents
a. The clinical effects are caused by the inhibition of the enzyme
acetylcholinesterase which allows excess acetylcholine to accumulate in the
nervous system
b. The excess accumulated acetylcholine causes hyperactivity in muscles, glands,
and nerves
2. Organophosphates Insecticides
a. Can be legally purchased by the general public
b. Organophosphate pesticides penetrate tissues and bind to the patient's body fat
producing a prolonged period of illness and ongoing toxicity even during aggressive
treatment
3. Nerve agents
a. Traditionally classified as weapons of mass destruction (WMD)
b. Not readily accessible to the general public
c. Extremely toxic and rapidly fatal with any route of exposure
d. GA (tabun), GB (sarin), GD (soman), GF, and VX are types of nerve agents and are WMDs

traumatic injuries above any radiation-associated injury
2. Identify and appropriately treat acute radiation injury
3. Reduce risk for contamination of personnel while caring for patients potentially or known to
be contaminated with radioactive material
Patient Presentation
Inclusion Criteria

inhalational exposure to particles (N95 face mask or respirator)
2. Identification and treatment of life-threatening injuries and medical problems takes priority
over decontamination
3. Do not eat or drink any food or beverages while caring for patients with radiation injuries until
screening completed for contamination and appropriate decontamination if needed
4. Use caution to avoid dispersing contaminated materials
5. Provide appropriate condition-specific care for any immediately life-threatening injuries or
medical problems

b. Treat per Seizures Guideline
Patient Safety Considerations
Treat life-threatening medical problems and traumatic injuries prior to assessing for and treating
radiation injuries or performing decontamination
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. Irradiated patients pose no threat to medical clinicians
2. Contaminated patients pose very little threat to medical clinicians who use appropriate PPE
including N95 masks or respirators, gloves, gowns, and face and eye protection
3. Sources of radiation
a. Legal
i. Industrial plants
ii. Healthcare facilities that provide radiologic services
iii. Nuclear power plants
iv. Mobile engineering sources (i.e., construction sites that are installing cement)
b. Illegal
i. Weapons of mass destruction
ii. "Dirty bomb" design to contaminate widespread areas
4. Physiology of radiation poisoning
c. Contamination: Poisoning from direct exposure to a radioactive source,
contaminated debris, liquids, or clothing where radiation continues to be emitted
from particles on surface
d. Exposure: Poisoning from radioactivity, in the form of ionizing rays,
penetrating through the bodily tissues of the patient
5. Common types of radioactivity that cause poisoning
e. Gamma rays
i. Highest frequency of ionizing rays
ii. Penetrates the skin deeply
iii. Causes the most severe radiation toxicity
f. Beta rays: can penetrate up to 1 cm of the skin's thickness
g. Alpha rays
i. Lowest frequency of ionizing rays
ii. Short range of absorption
iii. Dangerous only if ingested or inhaled
h. Radioactive daughters
i. Products of decay of the original radioactive substance
ii. Can produce gamma and beta rays (i.e., uranium decays into a series of radon
daughters)
6. In general, trauma patients who have been exposed to or contaminated by radiation
should be triaged and treated based on the severity of their conventional injuries
7. A patient who is contaminated with radioactive material (i.e., flecks of radioactive
material embedded in their clothing and skin) generally poses a minimal exposure risk to
medical personnel, although should not be placed in a contained space before
decontamination
8. EMS clinicians may be asked to assist public health agencies in the distribution and

administration of potassium iodide in a mass casualty incident involving radiation release
or exposure
9. Stages of Radiation Sickness
i. Prodromal: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, fever, agitation, starting hours up to
4 days after initial exposure
j. Latent: May last up to four weeks (this is the maximum period for
immunocompromise due to radiation exposure); however, time span may be less as
dose of radiation exposure increases. Symptoms include anorexia, fever, weakness,
bleeding, diarrhea, potentially altered mental status after two to three weeks
k. Recovery: may take weeks to months
Pertinent Assessment Findings
1. Treatment of life-threatening injuries or medical conditions takes priority over
assessment for contamination or initiation of decontamination
2. Time to nausea and vomiting is a reliable indicator of the received dose of ionizing
radiation. The more rapid the onset of vomiting, the higher the whole-body dose of
radiation
3. Tissue burns are a late finding (weeks following exposure) of ionizing radiation injury.
If burns are present acutely, they are from a thermal or chemical mechanism
4. Seizures may suggest acute radiation syndrome if accompanied by early vomiting. If
other clinical indicators do not suggest a whole-body dose of greater than 20 Gy,
consider other causes of seizure
5. Delayed symptoms (days to weeks after exposure or contamination)
a. Skin burns with direct contact with radioactive source
b. Skin burns or erythema from ionizing rays
c. Fever
d. Bone marrow suppression presenting as:
i. immunosuppression
ii. Petechiae
e. Spontaneous internal and external bleeding

Topical Chemical Burn
Aliases
Chemical Burn
Patient Care Goals
1. Rapid recognition of a topical chemical burn
2. Initiation of emergent and appropriate intervention and patient transport
Patient Presentation
Inclusion Criteria
1. Patients of all ages who have sustained exposure to a chemical that can cause a
topical chemical burn may develop immediate or in some cases a delayed clinical
presentation
2. Agents that are known to cause chemical burns include alkalis, acids, mustard agent,
and lewisite
Exclusion criteria
None noted
Patient Management
1. Don the appropriate PPE
2. Remove the patient's clothing, if necessary
3. Contaminated clothing should preferably be placed in double bags
4. If deemed necessary and manpower resources permit, the patient should be transported by
EMS clinicians who did not participate in the decontamination process, and in an emergency
response vehicle that has not been exposed to the chemical
5. Information regarding the chemical should be gathered while on scene including materials
safety data sheet if available
6. Communicate all data regarding the chemical to the receiving facility
Assessment
1. Clinical effects and severity of a topical chemical burn is dependent upon:
a. Class of agent (alkali injury or acid injury)
b. Concentration of the chemical the (higher the concentration, the greater the risk
of injury)
c. pH of the chemical
i. Alkali-increased risk with pH greater than or equal to 11
ii. Acid-increased risk with pH less than or equal to 3
d. Onset of burn
i. Immediate
ii. Delayed (e.g., hydrofluoric acid)
2. Calculate the estimated total body surface area that is involved
3. Prevent further contamination
4. Special attention to assessment of ocular or oropharyngeal exposure — evaluate for
airway compromise secondary to spasm or direct injury associated with oropharyngeal

burns
5. Some acid and alkali agents may manifest systemic effects
Treatment and Interventions
1. If dry chemical contamination, carefully brush off solid chemical prior to flushing the site
as the irrigating solution may activate a chemical reaction
2. If wet chemical contamination, flush the patient's skin (and eyes, if involved) with
copious amounts of water or normal saline
3. Provide adequate analgesia per the Pain Management Guideline
4. Consider the use of topical anesthetic eye drops (e.g., tetracaine) for chemical burns of
the eye
5. For eye exposure, administer continuous flushing of irrigation fluid to eye — Morgan lens
may facilitate administration
6. Early airway intervention for airway compromise or bronchospasm associated with
oropharyngeal burns
7. Take measures to minimize hypothermia
8. Initiate intravenous fluid resuscitation if necessary to obtain hemodynamic stability
Hydrofluoric Acid
Hydrofluoric acid (HF) is a highly corrosive substance that is primarily used for automotive
cleaning products, rust removal, porcelain cleaners, etching glass, cleaning cement or brick, or
as a pickling agent to remove impurities from various forms of steel. Hydrofluoric acid readily
penetrates intact skin and there may be underlying tissue injury. It is unlikely that low
concentration HF will cause an immediate acid-like burn however there may be delayed onset
of pain to the exposed area. Higher concentration HF may cause immediate pain as well as
more of a burn appearance that can range from mild erythema to an obvious burn. An oral or
large dermal exposure can result in significant systemic hypocalcemia with possible QT
prolongation and cardiovascular collapse
1. For all patients in whom a hydrofluoric acid exposure is confirmed or suspected:
a. Vigorously irrigate all affected areas with water or normal saline for a minimum of
15 minutes
b. Apply a cardiac monitor for oral or large dermal exposures significant HF exposures
c. Apply calcium preparation:
i. Calcium prevents tissue damage from hydrofluoric acid
ii. Topical calcium preparations:
1. Commercially manufactured calcium gluconate gel
2. If commercially manufactured calcium gluconate gel is not available, a
topical calcium gluconate gel preparation can be made by combining 150 mL
(5 ounces) of a sterile water-soluble gel (e.g., Surgilube® or KY® jelly) with
one of the following:
a. 35 mL of calcium gluconate 10% solution
b. 10 g of calcium gluconate tablets (e.g., Tums®)
c. 3.5 g calcium gluconate powder or
3. If calcium gluconate is not available, 10 mL of calcium chloride 10%
solution in 150 mL in sterile water-soluble gel (e.g., Surgilube® or KY® jelly)
4. Apply generous amounts of the calcium gluconate gel to the exposed skin
sites to neutralize the pain of the hydrofluoric acid

Version 3.0

a. Leave in place for at least 20 minutes then reassess
b. This can be repeated as needed
5. Hydrofluoric acid exposure is very painful. Calcium gel is the foundation of
pain control. While intravenous pain medications may be less effective, they
should be added to calcium gel to assist with pain control. Hydrofluoric acid
exposure typically causes pain out of proportion to the visible dermal effects.
Minimal skin changes may exist with substantial exposures
6. If fingers are involved, apply the calcium gel to the hand, squirt additional
calcium gel into a surgical glove, and then insert the affected hand into the
glove
7. For patients who have ingested hydrofluoric acid or who have a large dermal
exposure consider intravenous calcium gluconate, 1–2 grams of 10%
solution, as symptomatic hypocalcemia can precipitate rapidly as manifest
by muscle spasms, seizures, hypotension ventricular arrhythmias, and QT
prolongation
Patient Safety Considerations
1. Don PPE
2. Take measures to prevent the patient from further contamination through decontamination
3. Take measures to protect the EMS clinician and others from contamination
4. Do not attempt to neutralize an acid with an alkali or an alkali with an acid as an exothermic
reaction will occur and cause serious thermal injury to the patient
5. Expeditious transport or transfer to a designated burn center should be considered for burns
that involve a significant percentage of total body surface area or burns that involve the eyes,
face, hands, feet, or genitals
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. IV fluid resuscitation should be guided by patient age, percentage of body surface area
involved in burn, body habitus and calculated by the Parkland Formula [See Appendix
VI. Burn and Burn Fluid Charts]
2. Since the severity of topical chemical burns is largely dependent upon the type,
concentration, and pH of the chemical involved as well as the body site and surface area
involved, it is imperative to obtain as much information as possible while on scene about
the chemical substance by which the patient was exposed. The information gathering
process will often include:
a. Transport of the sealed container of the chemical to the receiving facility
b. Transport of the original or a copy of the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) of
the substance to the receiving facility
c. Contacting the reference agency to identify the chemical agent and assist
in management (e.g., CHEMTREC®)
3. Inhalation of HF should be considered in any dermal exposure involving the face and neck
or if clothing is soaked in the product
4. Decontamination is critical for both acid and alkali agents to reduce injury — removal of
chemicals with a low pH (acids) is more easily accomplished than chemicals with a high
pH (alkalis) because alkalis tend to penetrate and bind to deeper tissues
5. Some chemicals will also manifest local and systemic signs, symptoms, and bodily damage

Apply a cardiac monitor and examine rhythm strip for arrhythmias
Check blood glucose level
Monitor EtCO2 for respiratory decompensation
Check a 12-lead EKG when possible
Check for trauma, self-inflicted injury
Law enforcement should have checked for weapons and drugs, but you may need to
repeat the inspection

Treatment and Interventions
1. IV access for any fluids and meds
2. Give fluids for poor perfusion; cool fluids for hyperthermia [See Shock
Guideline and Hyperthermia/Heat Exposure Guideline]
3. Treat chest pain as acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and follow ST-Elevation Myocardial
Infarction (STEMI) Guideline if there is EKG is consistent with STEMI
4. Consider treating shortness of breath as atypical ACS
a. Administer oxygen as appropriate with a target of achieving 94–98% saturation
5. Consider soft physical management devices especially if law enforcement has been
involved in getting patient to cooperate [See Agitated or Violent Patient/Behavioral
Emergency Guideline ]
6. Consider medications to reduce agitation and other significant sympathomimetic findings,
preferably benzodiazepines, for the safety of the patients and clinicians. The administration
of ketamine should be considered for delirium with agitated behavior. This may improve
behavior and compliance [See Agitated or Violent Patient/Behavioral Emergency Guideline
]
a. If haloperidol or droperidol is used, maintain cardiac monitoring (or obtain 12-lead EKGs)
for QT-interval prolongation if feasible
7. Consider prophylactic use of antiemetic:
a. Adult: administer ondansetron 4–8 mg SLOW IV over 2–5 minutes or 4–8 mg IM or
8 mg orally disintegrating tablet
b. Pediatric: Administer ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg SLOW IV over 2–5 minutes
c. Do not use promethazine if haloperidol or droperidol are to be or have been given.
They all increase QT prolongation, but ondansetron has less seizure risk
8. If hyperthermia suspected, begin external cooling (e.g., cold or ice packs to axilla/groin)
Patient Safety Considerations
1. Apply the least amount of physical management devices that are necessary to protect the
patient and the clinicians [See Agitated or Violent Patient/Behavioral Emergency
Guideline ]
2. Assessment for potential weapons or additional drugs is very important since these
items can pose a threat not just to the patient but also to the EMS crew

Version 3.0

Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. Recognition and treatment of hyperthermia (including sedatives to decrease
heat production from muscular activity) is essential as many deaths are
attributable to hyperthermia
2. If law enforcement has placed the patient in handcuffs, this patient needs ongoing
physical security for safe transport. Have law enforcement in back of ambulance for the
handcuffed patient or make sure proper non-handcuff physical management devices are
in place before law enforcement leaves and ambulance departs from scene
3. If patient has signs and symptoms of ACS, consider giving nitroglycerin sublingual (SL)
q (quaque, every) 3–5 minutes if SBP greater than 100 mmHg and until pain resolves
(if range not desired, use q 3 minutes)
a. Vasospasm is often the problem in this case as opposed to a fixed coronary artery lesion
b. Consider administration of benzodiazepines as if to treat anxiety
4. Maintaining IV access, cardiac monitor, and SPO2/EtCO2 monitors are key to being able
to catch and intervene decompensations in a timely manner
a. If agitated, consider restraining the patient to facilitate patient assessment and
lessen likelihood of vascular access or monitor displacements
5. Cocaine has sodium channel blocking effects and can cause significant cardiac
conduction abnormalities with a widened QRS. Treatment is with sodium bicarbonate
similar to a tricyclic antidepressant. Check a 12-lead EKG to assess for these
complications
Pertinent Assessment Findings
1. History is as important as the physical examination.
2. If the patient is on psychiatric medication, but has failed to be compliant, this fact alone puts
the patient at higher risk for the adverse outcome of delirium with agitated behavior
3. If the patient is found naked, this may elevate the suspicion for stimulant use or abuse. These
substances increase the risk for sudden death secondary to delirium with agitated behavior.
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome or serotonin syndrome can present with similar signs and
symptoms
4. If polypharmacy is suspected, hypertension and tachycardia are expected hemodynamic
findings secondary to increased dopamine release. Stimulus reduction from benzodiazepines,
anti-psychotics, and ketamine will improve patient's vital signs and behavior
5. Be prepared for the potential of cardiovascular collapse as well as respiratory arrest
6. If a vasopressor is needed, epinephrine or norepinephrine is recommended over dopamine

Cyanide Exposure
Aliases
Blood agent

Cyanide

Hydrogen cyanide

Patient Care Goals
1. Remove patient from toxic environment
2. Assure adequate ventilation, oxygenation, and correction of hypoperfusion
Patient Presentation
Cyanide is a colorless gas or white crystal which binds to the ferric ion in cells, blocking the enzyme
cytochrome oxidase, thus preventing the use of oxygen by the cell's mitochondria, leading to cellular
hypoxia. While it has a characteristic "bitter almond smell”, genetically only 40% of the population can
smell it
Inclusion Criteria
1. Depending on its form, cyanide can enter the body through inhalation, ingestion, or
absorption through the skin. Cyanide should be suspected in occupational or other smoke
exposures (e.g., firefighting), industrial accidents, natural catastrophes, suicide and
murder attempts, chemical warfare, and terrorism (whenever there are multiple
casualties of an unclear etiology). Non-specific and early signs of cyanide exposure
(inhalation, ingestion, or absorption) include the following signs and symptoms: anxiety,
vertigo, weakness, headache, tachypnea, nausea, dyspnea, vomiting, and tachycardia
2. High concentrations of cyanide will produce:
a. Markedly altered level of consciousness, including rapid collapse
b. Seizures
c. Respiratory depression or respiratory arrest
d. Cardiac dysrhythmias (other than sinus tachycardia)
3. The rapidity of onset is related to the severity of exposure (inhalation or ingestion) and
may be dramatic with immediate effects that include early hypertension with subsequent
hypotension, sudden cardiovascular collapse or seizure/coma, and rapid death
Exclusion Criteria
None noted
Patient Management
Assessment
1. Remove patient from toxic environment
2. Assess ABCDs and, if indicated, expose the patient, and then re-cover the patient to
assure retention of body heat
3. Assess vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, neurologic status assessment)
including temperature and pulse oximetry (which may not correlate with tissue
oxygenation in cyanide/smoke exposure)
4. Attach a cardiac monitor and examine rhythm strip for arrhythmias
a. Perform a 12-lead EKG
5. Check blood glucose level

Version 3.0

6. Monitor pulse oximetry and EtCO2
7. Monitor patient for signs of hypoxia (pulse oximetry less than 94%) and
respiratory decompensation regardless of pulse oximetry reading
8. Identify the specific agent of exposure, time of ingestion/inhalation, and quantity/timing
of exposure
9. Obtain patient history including cardiovascular history and prescribed medication
10. Obtain other pertinent patient history
11. Perform physical exam
Treatment and Interventions
There is no widely available, rapid, confirmatory cyanide blood test. Many hospitals will not
be able to rapidly assess cyanide levels. Therefore, treatment decisions must be made on the
basis of clinical history and signs and symptoms of cyanide intoxication. For the patient with
an appropriate history and manifesting one or more significant cyanide exposure signs or
symptoms, treat with:
1. 100% oxygen via non-rebreather mask, CPAP, or bag valve mask
2. Collect a pre-treatment blood sample in the appropriate tube for lactate and cyanide levels, if
feasible
3. Administer one of the following medication regimes
a. Hydroxocobalamin (the preferred agent)
i. Adult: Administer hydroxocobalamin
1. Initial dose is 5 g administered over 15 minutes slow IV
2. Each 5 g vial of hydroxocobalamin for injection is to be reconstituted with
200 mL of LR, NS, or D5W (25 mg/mL) and administered at 10–15
mL/minute
3. An additional 5 g dose may be administered with medical consultation.
ii. Pediatric: Administer hydroxocobalamin 70 mg/kg (reconstitute concentration is
25 mg/mL)
4. Each 5 g vial of hydroxocobalamin for injection is to be reconstituted with
200 mL of LR, NS, or DSW (25 mg/mL) and administered at 10–15
mL/minute
i. Maximum single dose is 5 g
OR
b. Sodium thiosulfate
i. Adult: Sodium thiosulfate 12.5 g IVF (50 mL of 25% solution)
ii. Pediatric: Sodium thiosulfate 0.5 g/kg IV (2 mL/kg of 25% solution)
4. If seizure, treat per Seizures Guideline
Patient Safety Considerations
1. In the event of multiple casualties, be sure to wear appropriate PPE during rescue evacuation
from the toxic environment
2. If the patient ingests cyanide, it will react with the acids in the stomach generating hydrogen
cyanide gas. Be sure to maximize air circulation in closed spaces (ambulance) as the patient's
gastric contents may contain hydrogen cyanide gases when released with vomiting or belching
3. Do not use nitrites in conjunction with suspected carbon monoxide poisoning as it worsens
the hemoglobin oxygen carrying capacity even more than carbon monoxide (CO)
4. Hydroxocobalamin is only agent safe for treatment of cyanide poisoning in pregnant patients

Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. Pulse oximetry accurately reflects serum levels of oxygen but does not accurately reflect
tissue oxygen levels therefore should not be relied upon in possible cyanide and/or
carbon monoxide toxicity
2. After hydroxocobalamin has been administered, pulse oximetry levels are no longer
accurate and skin, tears, and urine will all turn red. This flushing should not be interpreted
as an allergic reaction
3. If the patient ingests cyanide, it will react with the acids in the stomach generating
hydrogen cyanide gas. Be sure to maximize air circulation in closed spaces (ambulance) as
the patient's gastric contents may contain hydrogen cyanide gases when released with
vomiting or belching
4. Amyl nitrite and sodium nitrite are no longer being used and no longer available
in commercial kits

8. Patient pertinent history
9. Patient physical
Treatment and Interventions
1. Consider activated charcoal without sorbitol (1 g/kg) PO only if within the first hour of
ingestion, if indicated per the time of ingestion. If risk of rapid decreasing mental status, do
not administer oral agent without adequately protecting the airway
a. If risk of rapid decreasing mental status, do not administer oral agent
without adequately protecting the airway
2. Check blood glucose level on all patients but especially on pediatric patients as betablockers can cause hypoglycemia in pediatric population
3. Consider atropine sulfate for symptomatic bradycardia
a. Adult: Atropine 1 mg IV q 5 minutes to maximum of 3 mg
b. Pediatric: Atropine 0.02 mg/kg (0.5 mg maximum) q 5 minutes, maximum total dose
1 mg
4. Consider fluid challenge (20 mL/kg) for hypotension with associated bradycardia
5. For symptomatic patients with cardiac effects (e.g., hypotension, bradycardia) consider:
a. Adult: Glucagon initial dose 5 mg IVP — this can be repeated in 5–10 minutes for a
total of 10 mg
b. Pediatric:
i. Glucagon 1 mg IVP (25–40 kg) every 5 minutes as necessary
ii. Glucagon 0.5 mg IVP (less than 25 kg) q 5 minutes as necessary
6. Consider vasopressors after adequate fluid resuscitation (1–2 liters of crystalloid) for
the hypotensive patient [See Shock Guideline for pediatric vs. adult dosing]
7. Consider transcutaneous pacing if refractory to initial pharmacologic interventions
8. If seizure, treat per Seizures Guideline
9. If widened QRS (100 msec or greater), consider sodium bicarbonate 1–2 mEq/kg IV. This
can be repeated as needed to narrow QRS
Patient Safety Considerations
1. Transcutaneous pacing may not always capture nor correct hypotension when capture is
successful
2. Aspiration of activated charcoal can cause airway management to be nearly impossible. Do
not administer activated charcoal to any patients that may have a worsening mental status

Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. Pediatric Considerations
a. Pediatric patient may develop hypoglycemia from beta blocker overdose therefore it
is important to perform glucose evaluation
b. A single pill can kill a toddler. It is very important that a careful assessment
of medications the toddler could have access to is done by EMS and all
suspect medications should be brought into the ED
2. Glucagon has a side effect of increased vomiting at these doses and
ondansetron prophylaxis may be considered
3. Atropine may have little or no effect (likely to be more helpful in mild overdoses) —
the hypotension and bradycardia may be mutually exclusive, and the blood pressure
may not respond to correction of bradycardia
4. Propranolol crosses the blood brain barrier and can cause altered mental status,
seizure, and widened QRS similar to TCA toxicity
Pertinent Assessment Findings
1. Certain beta-blockers, such as acebutolol and propranolol, may increase QRS duration
2. Certain beta-blockers, such as acebutolol and pindolol, may produce tachycardia and
hypertension
3. Sotalol can produce increase in QTc interval and ventricular dysrhythmias
4. Frequent reassessment is essential as patient deterioration can be rapid and catastrophic

6. Patient pertinent history
7. Patient physical with special consideration to area of envenomation especially crotalid bite
Treatment and Interventions
1. Consider an IV fluid bolus (normal saline or lactated Ringer's) 20 mL/kg up to 2 liters
2. Consider vasopressors after adequate fluid resuscitation for the hypotensive patient
[for adult vs. pediatric dosing, see Shock Guideline]
3. If seizure, treat per Seizures Guideline
4. Specific therapy for select bites, stings, or envenomation
a. Envenomations that are known to antivenom readily available in the USA include
black widow spider, bark scorpions, crotalid snakes (rattlesnake, copperhead) and
coral snakes
i. For these envenomations, consider transport to a hospital that has access to
antivenom, if feasible
b. Jellyfish
i. As there is a significant variety and diversity of jellyfish, it is important to be
familiar with the species and the appropriate treatment for your local aquatic
creatures
ii. Generally, scrape off any remaining tentacles or nematocysts, then immerse
affected body part in hot water (113°F/45°C). Vinegar may be used to reduce pain
due to deactivation of the nematocysts remaining in the skin except for stings
from certain species of jellyfish (i.e., Physalia, a species found in Australian
waters) which may have nematocysts activated by vinegar (acetic acid). Vinegar
may also activate the nematocysts of sea nettles and is not recommended after
this type of jellyfish exposure
c. Lionfish, scorpionfish, stingray:
i. Immerse affected body part in hot water to reduce the pain associated with the
toxin
5. Provide adequate analgesia per the Pain Management Guideline
Patient Safety Considerations
1. Do NOT:
a. Apply tourniquets, tight Ace®/crepe bandage, or constricting bands above or below
the site of the envenomation
b. Incise and/or suction wound to remove toxin
c. Apply cold packs or immerse the effect extremity in ice water (cryotherapy)
2. EMS clinicians should not try to capture the marine or terrestrial animal or insect
3. If the organism has been killed, beware that many dead insect, marine, or fanged animals
can continue to bite or sting with venom and should be safely placed in a hard sided and
closed container for future identification
4. Patient may still have an imbedded stinger, tooth, nematocyst, or barb which may
continue to deliver toxin if left imbedded. Consider safe removal without squeezing the
toxin delivery apparatus

i. Adult: Calcium gluconate 2–6 g slow IVP over 10 minutes
ii. Pediatric: Calcium gluconate 60 mg/kg IVP over 10 minutes
b. Calcium chloride
i. Adult: Calcium chloride 0.5–1 g slow IVP (50 mg/minute)
ii. Pediatric: Calcium chloride 20 mg/kg (0.2 mL/kg) slow IVP over 10 minutes (50
mg/mL) Maximum dose 1 g or 10 mL (Calcium gluconate is preferred as Calcium
chloride has increased risk of tissue damage in pediatrics)
4. Consider IV fluid bolus (normal saline or lactated Ringer's) 20 mL/kg up to 2 liters
5. Consider vasopressors after adequate fluid resuscitation for the hypotensive patient
[See Shock Guideline for adult vs. pediatric dosing]
6. If atropine, calcium, and vasopressors have failed in the symptomatic bradycardia
patient, consider:
a. Adult: Glucagon 5 mg IVP, then 1 mg q 5 minutes IVP (may require 5–15 mg to see
effect)
b. Pediatric:
i. Glucagon 1 mg IVP (25–40 kg); q 5 minutes as necessary
ii. Glucagon 0.5 mg IVP (less than 25 kg); q 5 minutes as necessary
7. Consider transcutaneous pacing if refractory to initial pharmacologic interventions
8. If seizure, consider midazolam (benzodiazepine of choice). [See Seizures Guideline for adult vs.
pediatric dosing]
Patient Safety Considerations
Transcutaneous pacing may not always capture nor correct hypotension when capture is
successful.
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. While most calcium channel blockers cause bradycardia, dihydropyridine class calcium
channel blockers (e.g., nifedipine, amlodipine) can cause a reflex tachycardia (torsade de
pointes) early in the ingestion. The patient can become bradycardic as the intoxication
worsens

2. The avoidance of administering calcium chloride or calcium gluconate to a patient on cardiac
glycosides (e.g., digoxin) as this may precipitate toxicity and associate fatal arrhythmias is felt
to be a historical belief and not supported
3. Glucagon has a side effect of increased vomiting at these doses and ondansetron prophylaxis
should be considered
4. A single pill can kill a toddler. It is very important that a careful assessment of medications the
toddler could have access to is done by EMS and suspect medications brought into the ED
5. Calcium channel blockers can cause many types of rhythms that can range from sinus
bradycardia to complete heart block
6. Hyperglycemia is the result of the blocking of L-type calcium channels in the pancreas. This
can help differentiate these ingestions from beta-blockers. There may also be a relationship
between the severity of the ingestion and the extent of the hyperglycemia
7. Atropine may have little or no effect (likely to be more helpful in mild overdoses)
a. Hypotension and bradycardia may be mutually exclusive, and the blood pressure
may not respond to correction of bradycardia
Pertinent Assessment Findings
1. Close monitoring of EKG changes and dysrhythmias
2. Serial frequent assessments are essential as these patients often have rapid deterioration with
profound hypotension

Carbon Monoxide/Smoke Inhalation
Aliases
CO
Patient Care Goals
1. Remove patient from toxic environment.
2. Assure adequate ventilation, oxygenation, and correction of hypoperfusion.
3. Consider use of environmental carbon monoxide (CO) monitors on "first in" bags to assist in
detection of occult CO toxicity.
Patient Presentation
Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas which has a high affinity for binding to red cell hemoglobin,
thus preventing the binding of oxygen to the hemoglobin, leading to tissue hypoxia (although pulse
oximetry may appear to be normal). A significant reduction in oxygen delivery to tissues and organs occurs
with carbon monoxide poisoning. Carbon monoxide is also a cellular toxin which can result in delayed or
persistent neurologic sequelae in significant exposures. With any form of combustion (fire/smoke [e.g.,
propane, kerosene, or charcoal stoves or heaters], combustion engines [e.g., generators, lawn mowers,
motor vehicles, home heating systems]), carbon monoxide will be generated. People in a fire may also be
exposed to cyanide from the combustion of some synthetic materials. Cyanide toxicity may need to be
considered in the hemodynamically unstable patient removed from a fire.
Inclusion Criteria
1. Patients exposed to carbon monoxide may present with a spectrum of symptoms:
a. Mild intoxication:
i. Nausea
ii. Fatigue
iii. Headache
iv. Vertigo
v. Lightheadedness
b. Moderate to severe:
i. Altered mental status
ii. Tachypnea
iii. Tachycardia
iv. Convulsion
v. Cardiopulmonary arrest
Exclusion Criteria
None noted
Patient Management
Assessment
1. Remove patient from toxic environment
2. Assess ABCDs and, if indicated, expose patient and re-cover to assure retention of body heat
3. Vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, neurologic status assessment)
temperature, and O2 saturation, and EtCO2 if available

4. Apply a cardiac monitor, examine rhythm strip for arrhythmias, and obtain a 12-lead EKG if
available
5. Check blood glucose level
6. Monitor pulse oximetry and EtCO2 for respiratory decompensation
7. Patient pertinent history
8. Patient physical examination
Treatment and Interventions
1. 100% oxygen via non-rebreather mask or high flow oxygen by nasal cannula (HFNC) or CPAP or
bag valve mask or advanced airway as indicated
2. If seizure, treat per Seizures Guideline
3. Consider transporting patients with severe carbon monoxide poisoning directly to a facility
with hyperbaric oxygen capabilities if feasible and patient does not meet criteria for other
specialty care (e.g., trauma or burn)
Patient Safety Considerations
1. Consider affixing a carbon monoxide detector to an equipment bag that is routinely taken into
scene (if it signals alarm, don appropriate respiratory protection and exit scene) to assist with
detection of occult CO toxicity
2. Remove patient and response personnel from potentially hazardous environment as soon as
possible
3. Provide instruction to the patient, the patient's family, and other appropriate bystanders to
not enter the environment (e.g., building, car) where the carbon monoxide exposure occurred
until the source of the poisoning has been eliminated
4. Do not look for cherry red skin coloration as an indication of carbon monoxide poisoning, as
this is an unusual finding
5. CO oximeter devices may yield inaccurate low/normal results for patients with CO poisoning.
All patients with probable or suspected CO poisoning should be transported to the nearest
appropriate hospital based on their presenting signs and symptoms
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. Pulse oximetry is inaccurate due to the carbon monoxide binding with hemoglobin
2. As maternal carboxyhemoglobin levels do not accurately reflect fetal carboxyhemoglobin
levels, pregnant patients are more likely to be treated with hyperbaric oxygen
3. Consider cyanide toxicity if carbon monoxide poisoning is from a fire
Pertinent Assessment Findings
1. Early and repeat assessment of patient's mental status and motor function are extremely
useful in determining response to therapy and the need for hyperbaric therapy
2. Identification of possible etiology of poisoning
3. Time of symptom onset and time of initiation of exposure-specific treatment
4. Response to therapy

Patient Care Goals
1. Rapid recognition and intervention of a clinically significant opioid poisoning or overdose
2. Prevention of respiratory and/or cardiac arrest
Patient Presentation
Inclusion Criteria
Patients exhibiting decreased mental status, and respiratory depression of all age groups with
known or suspected opioid use or abuse. Lack of miosis (pinpoint pupils) is not a reliable sign for
ruling out opioid exposure, although its presence is consistent with such exposure
Exclusion Criteria
Patients with altered mental status exclusively from other causes (e.g., head injury, or
hypoglycemia)
Patient Management
1. Don the appropriate PPE. Note that opioids have minimal vapor pressure and do not pose an
exposure risk to rescuers unless aerosolized or ingested
2. Therapeutic interventions to support the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation should be
initiated prior to the administration of naloxone
3. If possible, identify specific medication taken (including immediate release versus sustained
release) time of ingestion, and quantity
4. Obtain and document pertinent cardiovascular history or other prescribed medications for
underlying disease
5. Be aware that unsecured hypodermic needles may be on scene if the intravenous route may
have been used by the patient, and that there is a higher risk of needle sticks during the
management of this patient population which may also have an increased incidence of bloodborne pathogens
6. Naloxone, an opioid antagonist, should be considered for administration to patients with
respiratory depression in a confirmed or suspected opioid overdose
7. Naloxone administration via the intravenous route provides more predictable bioavailability
and flexibility in dosing and titration
8. Naloxone administration via the intranasal or intramuscular routes or as a nebulized solution
provide additional options of medication delivery
9. If naloxone was administered to the patient prior to the arrival of EMS, obtain the dose and
route through which it was administered and, if possible, bring the devices containing the
dispensed naloxone with the patient along with all other medications on scene

Assessment
1. Assess the patient's airway, breathing, circulation, and mental status
2. Support the patient's airway by positioning, oxygen administration, and ventilator assistance
with a bag valve mask if necessary
3. Assess the patient for other etiologies of altered mental status including hypoxia (pulse
oximetry less than 94%), hypoglycemia, hypotension, and traumatic head injury
4. Legally prescribed opioids are also manufactured as an adhesive patch for transdermal
absorption, and if found, should be removed from the skin
Treatments and Interventions
1. Critical resuscitation (opening and/or maintaining the airway, provision of oxygen,
ensuring adequate circulation) should be performed prior to naloxone administration
2. If the patient has respiratory depression from a confirmed or suspected opioid
overdose, consider naloxone administration
a. The administration of the initial dose or subsequent doses can be incrementally
titrated until respiratory depression is reversed
3. Naloxone can be administered via the IV, IM, IN, or ETT routes. As the ETT route is not very
effective, its use should be reserved for dire circumstances with a patient in extremis with no
other choice
a. Adults: The typical initial adult dose ranges between 0.4–2 mg IV, IM, up to a dose of 4 mg
IN or 5 mg ETT
b. Pediatrics: The pediatric dose of naloxone is 0.1 mg/kg IV, IM, IN, or ETT
i. Maximum dose of 2 mg IV, IM, or ETT
ii. Maximum dose of 4 mg IN
4. Naloxone can be administered via the IV, IM, IN, or ETT routes. As the ETT route is not very
effective, its use should be reserved for dire circumstances with a patient in extremis with no
other choice
a. Adults: The typical initial adult dose ranges between 0.4–2 mg IV, IM, up to a dose
of 4 mg IN or 5 mg ETT
b. Pediatrics: The pediatric dose of naloxone is 0.1 mg/kg IV, IM, IN, or ETT
i. Maximum dose of 2 mg IV, IM, or ETT
ii. Maximum dose of 4 mg IN
c. Naloxone provided to laypersons and non-medical first responders via public access
programs or prescriptions may be provided as a pre-measured dose in an auto-injector or
nasal spray or as a pre-measured, but variable, dose and/or concentration in a needleless
syringe with a mucosal atomization device (MAD) on the hub
d. Naloxone auto-injectors contain 0.4 mg/0.4 mL or 2 mg/0.4 mL
i. The cartons of naloxone auto-injectors prescribed to laypersons contain two
naloxone auto-injectors and one trainer
e. Naloxone nasal spray is manufactured in a single-use bottle that contains 4 mg/0.1 mL
f. For the intranasal route when naloxone is administered via a needleless syringe
(preferably with MAD on the hub), divide administration of the dose equally
between the nostrils to a maximum of 1 mL per nostril
g. The administration of naloxone can be titrated until adequate respiratory effort
is achieved if administered with a syringe IV, IM, IN, or ETT
h. Naloxone has no benefit in the treatment of cardiac arrest. Do not delay other

interventions such as chest compressions and ventilations
5. High-potency opioids [See Key Considerations] may require higher and/or more
frequently administered doses of naloxone to reverse respiratory depression and/or to
maintain adequate respirations
6. Regardless of the doses of naloxone administered, airway management with provision
of adequate oxygenation and ventilation is the primary goal in patients with confirmed
or suspected opioid overdose
Patient Safety Considerations
1. Clinical duration of naloxone
a. The clinical opioid reversal effect of naloxone is limited and may end within an hour
whereas opioids often have a duration of 4 hours or longer
b. Monitor the patient for recurrent respiratory depression and decreased mental status
2. Opioid withdrawal
a. Patients with altered mental status secondary to an opioid overdose may become agitated
or violent following naloxone administration due to opioid withdrawal therefore the goal
is to use the lowest dose as possible to avoid precipitating withdrawal
b. Be prepared for this potential scenario and take the appropriate measures in advance to
ensure and maintain scene safety
3. EMS clinicians should be prepared to initiate airway management before, during, and after
naloxone administration and to provide appropriate airway support until the patient has
adequate respiratory effort
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. The essential feature of opioid overdose requiring EMS intervention is
respiratory depression or apnea, managed by ventilation followed by naloxone
2. Some opioids have additional toxic effects (i.e., methadone can produce QT
prolongation and tramadol can produce seizures)
3. Overuse and abuse of prescribed and illegal opioids has led to an increase in accidental
and intentional opioid overdoses
4. Opioid combinations:
a. Some opioids are manufactured as a combination of analgesics with acetaminophen,
acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), or other substances
b. In the scenario of an overdose, there is a potential for multiple drug toxicities
c. Examples of opioid combination analgesics:
i. Vicodin® is a combination of acetaminophen and hydrocodone
ii. Percocet® is a combination of acetaminophen and oxycodone
iii. Percodan® is a combination of aspirin and oxycodone
iv. Suboxone® is a combination of buprenorphine and naloxone
5. High-potency opioids:
a. Fentanyl is 50–100 times more potent than morphine. It is legally manufactured in an
injectable and oral liquid, tablet, and transdermal (worn as a patch) forms however much
of the fentanyl adulterating the heroin supply are illegal fentanyl analogs such as acetyl
fentanyl
b. Carfentanil is 10,000 times more potent than morphine
i. It is legally manufactured in a liquid form; however, a powder or tablet is the

most common form of this drug that is illegally produced
ii. In the concentration in which it is legally manufactured (3 mg/mL), an
intramuscular dose of 2 mL of carfentanil will sedate an elephant
c. Synthetic opioids (i.e., W-18 are 10,000 times more potent than morphine) many
synthetic opioids are not detectable by routine toxicology screening assays
6. The IN route has the benefit of no risk of needle stick to the clinician
7. Patients with opioid overdose from fentanyl or fentanyl analogs may rapidly exhibit
chest wall rigidity and require positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), in addition to
multiple and/or larger doses of naloxone, to achieve adequate ventilation
Pertinent Assessment Findings
1. The primary clinical indication for the use of opioid medications is analgesia
2. In the opioid overdose scenario, signs and symptoms include:
a. Miosis (pinpoint pupils)
b. Respiratory depression
c. Decreased mental status
3. Additional assessment precautions:
a. The risk of respiratory arrest with subsequent cardiac arrest from an opioid overdose
as well as hypoxia (pulse oximetry less than 94%), hypercarbia, and aspiration may be
increased when other substances such as alcohol, benzodiazepines, or other
medications have also been taken by the patient
b. Pediatric Considerations: The signs and symptoms of an opioid overdose may also be
seen in newborns who have been delivered from a mother with recent or chronic
opioid use. Neonates who have been administered naloxone for respiratory
depression due to presumed intrauterine opioid exposure may be narcotic dependent
and should be monitored closely for seizures

Patient Care Goals
Rapid recognition of the signs and symptoms of confirmed or suspected airway respiratory irritants
Patient Presentation
Inclusion Criteria
1. Inhalation of a variety of gases, mists, fumes, aerosols, or dusts may cause irritation or injury
to the airways, pharynx, lung, asphyxiation, or other systemic effects
2. Inhaled airway/respiratory irritant agents will interact with the mucous membranes, upper
and lower airways based on solubility, concentration, particle size, and duration of exposure
3. The less soluble and smaller the particle size of the agent the deeper it will travel into the
airway and respiratory systems the inhaled toxic agent will go before reacting with adjoining
tissues thus causing a greater delay in symptom onset
Signs and Symptoms
1. As the type, severity and rapidity of signs and symptom onset depends on agent, water
solubility, concentration, particle size, and duration of exposure, the below signs and
symptoms are often overlapping and escalating in severity
2. Many airways and respiratory irritant agents have "warning properties" such as identifiable or
unpleasant smells or irritation to eyes or airways
3. Some agents do not have clear warning properties and will often have delayed onset of any
sign or symptom:
a. Unusual odor/smell
b. Tearing or itchy eyes
c. Burning sensation and burns to the nose, pharynx, and respiratory tract
d. Sneezing
e. General excitation
f. Cough
g. Chest tightness
h. Nausea
i. Shortness of breath/dyspnea
j. Wheezing
k. Stridor
l. Dyspnea on exertion
m. Dizziness Upper
n. Change in voice
o. Airway obstructions include laryngospasm and laryngeal edema
p. Pulmonary edema (non-cardiogenic)
q. Seizures
r. Cardiopulmonary arrest

a. Physical presences of paint or residue on individual from the inhaled agent
b. Slurred speech
c. Altered mental status (excitation, drowsiness to unconsciousness)
d. Loss of consciousness
e. Cardiac dysrhythmias
f. Cardiopulmonary arrest
Patient Management
1. Don appropriate PPE — respiratory protection critical
2. Remove patient from the toxic environment
a. Remove the patient's clothing that may retain gases or decontaminate if liquid or
solid contamination
b. Flush irrigated effected/burned areas
3. Rapidly assess the patient's respiratory status, mental status, and oxygenation
4. Administer (humidified if available) oxygen
5. Establish intravenous access (if possible)
6. Apply a cardiac monitor (if available)
7. Continuous and ongoing patient reassessment is critical
Assessment
1. Make sure the scene is safe as many gases are heavier than air and will build up in low lying
areas. This is especially true of hydrogen sulfide and it's "knock down" effect of the initial
unprotected responder and subsequence casualties associated with unprotected rescuers
attempting to safe the first downed responder
2. Consider BSI or appropriate PPE
3. Remove patient from toxic environment
4. Decontaminate
5. Assess ABCD and if indicated, expose the patient, and then cover the patient to assure
retention of body heat
6. Vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, neurologic status assessment) which
include temperature

7. Place cardiac monitor and examine rhythm strip for arrhythmia potentials (consider 12-lead
EKG)
8. Check blood glucose Level
9. Monitor pulse oximetry and EtCO2 for respiratory decompensation
10. Perform carboxyhemoglobin and cyanide device assessment, if available
11. Identify specific suspected agent if possible
12. Pertinent cardiovascular history or other prescribed medications for underlying disease
13. Patient pertinent history
14. Patient physical examination
Treatment and Interventions
1. Assure a patent airway
2. Administer (humidified if available) oxygen and if hypoventilation, toxic inhalation,
or desaturation noted, support breathing
a. Maintain the airway and assess for airway burns, stridor, or airway edema and if
indicated, perform intubation early (recommendation to avoid supraglottic airways
— cricothyrotomy may be required in rare severe cases
b. Non-invasive ventilation techniques
i. Use continuous CPAP, BiPAP, intermittent positive pressure breathing (IPPB),
HFNC, and/or bilevel nasal CPAP for severe respiratory distress or impending
respiratory failure
ii. Use bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation in the setting of hypoventilation,
respiratory failure, or arrest
3. While albuterol 2.5 mg nebulized is usually sufficient for mild wheezing without clinical
distress, albuterol 5 mg nebulized (or 6 puffs metered dose inhaler) should be
administered to all patients in respiratory distress with signs of bronchospasm either by
basic life support BLS or ALS clinicians. This medication should be repeated at this dose
with unlimited frequency for ongoing distress
4. lpratropium 0.5 mg nebulized should be given up to 3 doses, in conjunction with albuterol
5. Initiate IV access for infusion of lactated Ringer's or normal saline and obtain blood
samples in effort to record pre-treatment levels, e.g., via point-of-care testing, associated
with EMS management (e.g., glucose, lactate, cyanide)
6. Fluid bolus (20 mL/kg) if evidence of hypoperfusion
7. If the patient is experiencing significant pain, administer IV/IO analgesics
a. Morphine sulfate 0.1 mg/kg IV or IO
b. Fentanyl 1 mcg/kg IV or IO
8. Eye irrigation early
9. Treat topical chemical burns [See appropriate Toxins and Environmental
Section guideline(s)]
10. In severe respiratory irritation, in particular hydrogen sulfide, with altered mental status and
no improvement with removal from the toxic environment, administer oxygen (humidified if
available) as appropriate with a target of achieving 94–98% saturation. Consider consultation
for transfer to a tertiary care hospital. If carbon monoxide is a confirmed or suspected
element of the inhalant, a facility with hyperbaric oxygen capabilities is preferred

Version 3.0

Medication Administration
1. If wheezing is present, consider administering inhaled albuterol (2.5–5 mg) as nebulized, or
four to eight puffs metered dose inhaler
2. lpratropium 0.5 mg nebulized should be given in conjunction with albuterol, up to three doses
Patient Safety Considerations
1. Generally, speaking to patients with exposure to highly soluble airway/respiratory irritants you
will find that they have self-extricated due to the warning properties such as the smell,
rapidity of onset of irritation, and other symptoms
2. The less soluble agents may generate only an odor (e.g., mowed hay smell for Phosgene) and
will have delayed serious symptoms such as acute pulmonary edema, hypoxia, and shortness
of breath with minimal exertion
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. Airway respiratory irritants can exacerbate underlying reactive airway diseases (e.g.,
asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) and precipitate or exacerbate
bronchospasm, respiratory distress, and hypoxia
2. As patients may be off gassing (particularly hydrogen sulfide and hydrogen cyanide) in the
back of the transport vehicle, it is important to have adequate ventilation of the patient
compartment
3. Removal from the toxic environment, oxygen (humidified if available), general supportive
therapy, bronchodilators, respiratory support, and rapid transport are core elements of
care as there are no specific antidotes for any of these inhaled agents except for heavy
metals that may be chelated in-hospital after agent identification
4. Hydrogen sulfide causes the cells responsible for the sense of smell to be stunned into
inaction and therefore with a very short exposure will shut down and the exposed victim
will not perceive the smell, yet the victim continues to absorb the gas as it is still present
5. Inhaled agents have become popular as a means of committing suicide. If there is some
form of suicide signage, hoses, or buckets of substances visible as you arrive at the
vehicle or residence, immediately retreat to well ventilated area and don self-contained
breathing apparatus (SCBA) before opening the vehicle or making entry as these gases
may be highly concentrated and potentially lethal to EMS responders
6. Household bathroom, kitchen, and oven cleaners when mixed can generate various
airway respiratory irritants (ammonia, chloramine, and chlorine gas releases are
particularly common). A very common exposure is to chloramine, a gas liberated when
bleach (hypochlorite) and ammonia are combined. Chloramine then hydrolyzes in the
distal airways and alveoli to ammonia and hypochlorous acid
7. Sudden sniffing death can result from a single use of inhalant of abuse
a. Some inhalants can cause cardiac arrest due to dysrhythmias from irritated
myocardium
b. This syndrome most often is associated with abuse of butane, propane, and effects
of the chemicals in the aerosols
Pertinent Assessment Findings
1. Patient may describe a specific odor (chlorine swimming pool smell, ammonia smell,

Patient Safety Considerations
1. Toxicity is related to duration of exposure and concentration of agent used (exposure in nonventilated space)
2. Patients with pre-existing pulmonary conditions (e.g., asthma, COPD) may be prone to more
severe respiratory effects
3. Traumatic injury may result when exposed individuals are in proximity to the device used to
disperse the riot control agent (e.g., hose/stream under pressure, riot control agent projectile,
grenade)
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. CN, CS, and OC are the most encountered riot control agents
2. CN, CS, and OC have a high safety ratio. All three have a high median lethal
concentration (LCt50) and a low median effective concentration (ECt50)
3. Toxicity is related to time of exposure and concentration of agent used (exposure in
non-ventilated space)
4. Symptoms that may be experienced after exposure:
a. Eyes: tearing, pain, conjunctivitis, blurred vision
b. Nose/mouth/throat: rhinorrhea, burning/pain, trouble swallowing, drooling
c. Lungs: chest tightness, coughing, choking sensation, wheezing, dyspnea
d. Skin: burning, redness, dermatitis
e. GI: nausea and vomiting are rare and may be posttussive
5. Symptoms begin within seconds of exposure, are self-limited and are best treated by
removing patient from ongoing exposure. Symptoms frequently decrease over time (15–
45 minutes) after exposure ends
Pertinent Assessment Findings
1. Riot control agent used
2. Symptoms of exposed
3. Lung sounds
4. Evidence of other traumatic injuries

Definitions
1. Heat Cramps: are muscle cramps usually in the legs and abdominal wall. Patient temperature
is normal
2. Heat Exhaustion: has both salt and water depletion usually of a gradual onset. As it progresses
tachycardia, hypotension, elevated temperature, and very painful cramps occur. Symptoms of
headache, nausea, and vomiting occur. Heat exhaustion can progress to heat stroke
3. Heat Stroke: occurs when the cooling mechanism of the body ceases due to temperature
overload and/or electrolyte imbalances. Patient core temperature is usually greater than
104°F. When no thermometer is available, it is distinguished from heat exhaustion by altered
level of consciousness, seizures, or coma
4. Heat Syncope: transient loss of consciousness with spontaneous return to normal mentation,
attributable to heat exposure
Patient Care Goals
1. Cooling and rehydration
2. Mitigate high-risk for decompensation

8. Cooling efforts should continue until the patient's temperature is less than 102.2°F
(39°C) or, if continuous temperature monitoring is not available, until the patient
demonstrates improvement in mental status
9. Establish IV access for patients suffering from heat stroke — give cool fluids at 20
mL/kg boluses and reduce to 10 mL/kg/hr boluses when vitals are stable
10. Monitor for arrhythmia and cardiovascular collapse [See Cardiovascular Section]
11. Treat seizures, per the Seizures Guideline
12. All patients suffering from life threatening heat illness (including heat stroke) should
be transported to the hospital
Patient Safety Considerations
Consider use of physical securing devices [See Agitated or Violent Patient/Behavioral Emergency
Guideline] to protect vascular access sites.

Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. Patients at risk for heat emergencies include neonates, infants, geriatric patients,
and patients with mental illness
2. Contributory risk factors may come from:
a. Prescription and over-the-counter herbal supplements
b. Cold medications
c. Heart medications
d. Diuretics
e. Psychiatric medications
f. Drug abuse
g. Accidental or intentional drug overdose
3. Heat exposure can occur either due to increased environmental temperatures or
prolonged exercise or a combination of both
a. Environments with temperature greater than 90°F and humidity greater than 60% present
the most risk
4. Heat stroke is associated with cardiac arrhythmias independent of drug
ingestion/overdose Heat stroke has also been associated with cerebral edema
5. For patients with signs and symptoms of heat stroke, rapid cooling takes priority over
other interventions (e.g., cardiac monitoring, IV access)
6. Do not forget to look for other causes of altered mental status such as low blood glucose
level, or, in the proper circumstances (i.e., endurance exercise events), consider exercise
associated hyponatremia (EAH), especially in the patient with altered mental status,
normal blood glucose, and normal temperature
7. Controversy: shivering may occur while treating heat stroke
a. It is uncertain how harmful shivering is to heat stroke patients
b. Cooling should be continued until the above temperature and mental status goals
are met
c. Treat shivering as above
d. Research does not demonstrate the value of one benzodiazepine over another
in shivering patients or any value of other medications
8. Hyperthermia not from environmental factors has a differential that includes the following:
a. Fever and delirium
b. Hyperthyroid storm
c. Delirium tremens (DTs)
d. CNS lesion or tumor
e. Adverse drug event: neuroleptic malignant syndrome, malignant hyperthermia
f. Mental status changes without hyperthermia in the correct circumstances could be
exercise associated hyponatremia
9. There is no evidence supporting EMS obtaining orthostatic vital signs as a clinical indicator
Pertinent Assessment Findings
1. Warning signs: fever, altered mental status
2. Blood glucose level for AMS

Hypothermia

Patient Care Goals
1. Maintain hemodynamic stability
2. Prevent further heat loss
3. Rewarm the patient in a safe manner
4. Appropriate management of hypothermia induced cardiac arrest
5. Prevent loss of limbs
Patient Presentation
1. Patients may suffer from hypothermia due to exposure to a cold environment (increased heat
loss) or may suffer from a primary illness or injury that, in combination with cold exposure
(heat loss in combination with decreased heat production), leads to hypothermia
2. Patients may suffer systemic effects from cold (hypothermia) or localized effects (i.e.,
frostbite)
3. Patients with mild hypothermia will have normal mental status, shivering, and may have
normal vital signs while patients with moderate to severe hypothermia will manifest mental
status changes, eventual loss of shivering and progressive bradycardia, hypotension, and
decreased respiratory status
4. Patients with frostbite will develop numbness involving the affected body part along with a
"clumsy" feeling along with areas of blanched skin — later findings include a "woody"
sensation, decreased or loss of sensation, bruising or blister formation, or a white and waxy
appearance to affected tissue
Inclusion Criteria
Patients suffering systemic or localized cold injuries.
Exclusion Criteria
1. Patients without cold exposure
OR
2. Patients with cold exposure but no symptoms referable to hypothermia or frostbite
Patient Management
Assessment
1. Patient assessment should begin with attention to the primary survey, looking for
evidence of circulatory collapse and ensuring effective respirations
a. The patient suffering from moderate or severe hypothermia may have
severe alterations in vital signs including weak and extremely slow pulses,
profound hypotension, and decreased respirations
b. The rescuer may need to evaluate the hypothermic patient for a pulse for
longer than the normothermic patient (up to 60 seconds)
2. History: along with standard SAMPLE — type history, additional patient history
should include:
________________________

326

NASEMSO
National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines

Version 3.0

a. Attention to any associated injury or illness
b. Duration of cold exposure
c. Ambient temperature
d. Treatments initiated before EMS arrival
3. There are several means to categorize the severity of hypothermia based on either core
body temperature readings or clinical evaluation. If possible and reliable, EMS clinicians
should perform core body temperature measurements and categorize patients into one
of the three follow levels of hypothermia:
a. Mild: 32.1°–35°C/89.8°–95°F
b. Moderate: 28.1°–32°C/82.5°–89.7°F
c. Severe: 24°–28°C/75.2°–82.4°F
d. Profound: less than 24°C (75.2°F)
4. Equally important is the patient's clinical presentation and the signs or symptoms the
patient is experiencing — the above temperature-based categorization should be
balanced against these clinical findings
a. Mild: vital signs not depressed; normal mental status; shivering is preserved;
body maintains the ability to attempt to control temperature
b. Moderate/Severe: progressive bradycardia, hypotension, and decreased respirations,
alterations in mental status with eventual coma, shivering will be lost in moderate
hypothermia (generally between 30°–31°C (86°-87.8°F), and general slowing of bodily
functions; the body loses the ability to thermo-regulate
Treatment and Interventions
1. Maintain patient and rescuer safety
2. Manage airway per the Airway Management Guideline
3. Mild hypothermia:
a. Remove the patient from the environment and prevent further heat loss by removing
wet clothes and drying skin, insulate from the ground, shelter the patient from wind
and wet conditions, and insulate the patient with dry clothing or a hypothermia
wrap/blanket. Cover the patient with a vapor barrier and, if available, move the patient
to a warm environment
b. Hypothermic patients have decreased oxygen needs and may not require
supplemental oxygen
i. If oxygen is deemed necessary, it should be warmed to a maximum
temperature between 40°–42°C (104°–108°F) and humidified if possible
c. Provide beverages or foods containing glucose if feasible and patient is awake and
able to manage airway independently
d. Vigorous shivering can substantially increase heat production — shivering should
be fueled by caloric replacement
e. Consider field-rewarming methods such as placement of large heat packs or heat
blankets (chemical or electric if feasible) to the anterior chest or wrapped around the
patient's thorax if large enough — forced air warming blankets (e.g., Bair Hugger®)
can be an effective field rewarming method if available
f. Monitor frequently — if temperature or level of consciousness decreases, refer to
severe hypothermia
g. Consider IV access
i. Indications for IV access and IV fluids in the mildly hypothermic patient are
________________________

Version 3.0

similar to those of the non-hypothermic patient
ii. IV fluids, if administered, should be warmed, ideally to 42°C (107.6°F)
iii. Bolus therapy is preferable to continuous drip
h. If alterations in mental status, consider measuring blood glucose and treat as
indicated (treat per Hypoglycemia Guideline or Hyperglycemia Guideline) and assess
for other causes of alterations of mentation
i. Transport to a hospital capable of rewarming the patient
4. Moderate or severe hypothermia:
a. Perform ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation), pulse checks for patients suffering
hypothermia should be performed for 60 seconds, and obtain core temperature, if
possible, for patients exhibiting signs or symptoms of moderate/severe hypothermia
i. Core temperatures can be measured by esophageal probe, if one is available, the
patient's airway is secured, and the clinician has been trained in its insertion and
use.
ii. Rectal temperatures may also be used, with caution to avoid worsening the
hypothermia by undressing the patient (e.g., done in a warm environment such as
a heated ambulance)
iii. If neither esophageal nor rectal thermometers are available, an epitympanic field
thermometer with an isolating ear cap may be used, but is generally less accurate
b. Manage airway as needed
i. Care must be taken not to hyperventilate the patient as hypocarbia may reduce
the threshold for ventricular fibrillation in the cold patient
ii. Indications and contraindications for advanced airway devices are similar in the
hypothermic patient as in the normothermic patient
c. Prevent further heat loss by removing the patient from the environment and removing
wet clothes and drying skin, insulate from the ground, shelter the patient from wind
and wet conditions, and insulate the patient with dry clothing or a hypothermia
wrap/blanket. Cover the patient with a vapor barrier and, if available, move the patient
to a warm environment
d. Initiate field-rewarming methods such as placement of large heat packs or heat
blankets (chemical or electric if feasible) to the anterior chest or wrapped around the
patient's thorax if large enough
i. Chemical or electrical heat sources should never be applied directly to the skin
ii. Use a barrier between the skin and heat source to prevent burns
iii. Forced air warming blankets (e.g., Bair Hugger®) can be an effective field
rewarming method if available
e. Handle the patient gently
i. Attempt to keep the patient in the horizontal position, especially limiting motion
of the extremities to avoid increasing return of cold blood to the heart
ii. Once in a warm environment, clothing should be cut off (rather than removed
by manipulating the extremities)
iii. Move the patient only when necessary, such as to remove the patient from the
elements
f. Apply cardiac monitor or AED if available
g. Establish IV and provide warmed isotonic crystalloid bolus. Repeat as necessary
h. If alterations in mental status, consider measuring blood glucose and treat as
indicated (treat per Hypoglycemia Guideline or Hyperglycemia Guideline) and assess

for other causes of alterations of mentation
Transport as soon as possible to a hospital capable of resuscitation. If cardiac arrest
develops consider transport to a center capable of extracorporeal circulation (ECMO)
or cardiopulmonary bypass (if feasible)
j. Warm the patient compartment of the ambulance to at least 24°C (75.2°F) during
transport
5. Frost bite:
a. If the patient has evidence of frostbite, and ambulation/travel is necessary for
evacuation or safety, avoid rewarming of extremities until definitive treatment is
possible. Additive injury occurs when the area of frostbite is rewarmed then
inadvertently refrozen. Only initiate rewarming if refreezing is absolutely
preventable
i. If rewarming is feasible and refreezing can be prevented use circulating warm
water (37°–39°C/98.6°–102°F) to affected body part, thaw injury completely. If
warm water is not available, rewarm frostbitten parts by contact with nonaffected body surfaces. Do not rub or cause physical trauma.
ii. After rewarming, cover injured parts with loose sterile dressing. If blisters are
causing significant pain, and the clinician is so trained, these may be aspirated,
however, should not be de-roofed. Do not allow injury to refreeze. Treat per the
Pain Management Guideline.
i.

Patient Safety Considerations
1. Given the additive effects of additional cold stress, the patient should be removed from the
cold environment as soon as operationally feasible
2. In patients suffering from moderate to severe hypothermia, it is critical to not allow these
patients to stand or exercise as this may cause circulatory collapse
3. Devices that self-generate heat (e.g., heat packs) that are being utilized during the rewarming
process should be wrapped in a barrier to avoid direct contact with the skin and to prevent
burns. Available evidence suggests that heat packs with peak temperatures above 45°C
(113°F) are most likely to cause burns. In patients who are unresponsive, or unable to
recognize a developing injury, please check the area in which the heating pad is placed
regularly to ensure no tissue damage occurs.
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
Considerations in cardiac arrest
1. The following are contraindications for initiation of resuscitation in the hypothermic patient:
a. Obvious fatal injuries (such as decapitation)
b. The patient exhibits signs of being frozen (such as ice formation in the airway)
c. Chest wall rigidity such that compressions are impossible
d. Danger to rescuers or rescuer exhaustion
e. Avalanche victims buried for 35 minutes or longer with airway obstruction by ice
or snow
2. Fixed and dilated pupils, apparent rigor mortis, and dependent lividity may not
be contraindication for resuscitation in the severely hypothermic patient
3. The mainstay of therapy in severe hypothermia and cardiac arrest should be
effective chest compressions and attempts at rewarming. Chest compressions

Version 3.0

should be provided at the same rate as in normothermic patients
4. The temperature at which defibrillation should first be attempted in the severely
hypothermic cardiac arrest victim and the number of defibrillation attempts is unclear.
There are different approaches regarding resuscitation of the hypothermic arrest
patient
a. Per the American Heart Association (AHA), if the patient has a shockable rhythm
(VF/VT), defibrillation should be attempted. It is reasonable to continue defibrillation
attempts per AHA protocols concurrently with rewarming strategies
b. The state of Alaska's 2014 guidance on management of hypothermic patients in
cardiac arrest advises that defibrillation should be attempted once, followed by 2
minutes of chest compressions, then rhythm and pulse checks
i. If defibrillation is unsuccessful and the patient's core temperature is less than
30°C (86°F), do not make further attempts at defibrillation until the core
temperature has increased to greater than 30°C (86°F)
ii. Continue CPR and attempt to rewarm the patient
c. An alternate strategy, per the Wilderness Medical Society's accidental hypothermia
guideline, suggests that if the patient's core temperature is below 30°C (86°F),
attempt defibrillation once, then wait until the patient has been rewarmed at least
1°–2°C or to 30°C (86°F) before attempting additional shocks. It is noted that the
likelihood of successful defibrillation increases with every one-degree increase in
temperature
d. If defibrillation is unsuccessful and the patient's core temperature is greater than
30°C (86°F), follow guidelines for normothermic patients
e. If available monitors reveal asystole, CPR alone is the mainstay of therapy
f. If monitoring reveals an organized rhythm (other than VF or VT) and no pulses
are detected, do not start CPR, but continue to monitor
i. While this may represent pulseless electrical activity (PEA), this may also
represent situations in which the patient's pulses are not detectable but remain
effective due to decreased metabolic needs
ii. In the case of PEA, the rhythm will deteriorate rapidly to asystole, in which case, CPR
should be initiated
iii. Given the potential to cause VF with chest compressions, the Alaska guidance
offers that it is better to maintain effective cardiac activity than to start CPR and
cause VF
5. Manage the airway per standard care in cardiac arrest victims [See Cardiac Arrest Guideline]
a. In the absence of advanced airways, ventilate the patient at the same rate as
a normothermic patient
b. If the patient has an advanced airway, ventilate at half the rate recommended for
a normothermic patient to prevent hyperventilation. If EtCO2 is available, ventilate
to maintain normal EtCO2 levels
6. There is little evidence to guide use of medications in severe hypothermia with cardiac
arrest, however 2010 AHA updates to advanced cardiac life support recommend use of
vasopressors according to standard ACLS protocols while the 2014 Alaska guidelines and
the Wilderness Medical Society's accidental hypothermia guideline for the management of
hypothermic patients advises medications should be withheld until the patient's core
temperature is greater than 30°C (86°F)
a. Above 30°C (86°F), intervals between medication provision should be doubled until the

patient reaches 35°C (95°F), at which time, normal medication intervals may be
adopted
7. Upon ROSC, treat per Adult Post-ROSC Care Guideline
8. Patients with severe hypothermia and arrest may benefit from resuscitation even after
prolonged downtime, and survival with intact neurologic function has been observed
even after prolonged resuscitation
a. Patients should not be considered deceased until rewarming has been attempted
9. If a hypothermic patient clearly suffered cardiac arrest and subsequently became
hypothermic afterward with prolonged down time between arrest and rescue, there is
no rationale for initiating resuscitation and warming the patient

10. Fluid bolus as indicated
11. Advanced airway management as indicated. Consider CPAP in awake patients with
respiratory distress
12. Cardiac monitor
Patient Safety Considerations
1. Avoidance of hyperoxygenation of the drowning victim
2. Rescuer safety considerations
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. The World Health Organization definition of drowning is " the process of
experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquid"
2. Drowning is further defined in the following categories:
a. Non-fatal drowning: patients rescued from drowning
b. Fatal drowning: any death, acutely or subacutely, resulting from drowning
3. Submersion refers to situations in which the patient's airway is underwater. Immersion
refers to situations in which the patient's body is in water, but the patient's airway
remains out of the water
4. Pediatric Considerations:
a. Drowning is a common cause of death in children
b. Risk factors for drowning include male gender, age less than 14 years old, alcohol
use, lack of supervision, and risky behavior
5. Rescue efforts should be coordinated between all responding agencies to ensure patient
is rapidly accessed and removed from the water
6. Initiation of in-water ventilations may increase survival. In-water chest compressions are
futile
7. The European Resuscitation Council recommends five initial breaths be provided to
the drowning victim
a. The initial ventilations may be more difficult to achieve as water in the airways
may impede alveolar expansion
b. If cardiac arrest after 5 rescue breaths, refer to Cardiac Arrest Guideline.

8. Active efforts to expel water from the airway (by abdominal thrusts or other means)
should be avoided as they delay resuscitative efforts and increase the potential for
vomiting and aspiration
9. Long-standing teaching has suggested that rescuers should always assume c-spine injury
in victims of drowning
a. The 2010 American Heart Association update on special circumstances in cardiac arrest
notes that routine c-spine precautions in all victims of drowning is likely unnecessary
unless the mechanism or injury, history, or physical exam suggests a cervical spine
injury
b. Mechanisms of injury highly suggestive of cervical spine injury include diving,
water skiing, surfing, or watercraft accidents
10. Uncertainty exists regarding survival in cold water drowning; however, recent
literature suggests the following:
a. If water temperature is less than 43°F (6°C) and the patient is submerged with
evidence of cardiac arrest:
i. Survival is possible for submersion time less than 90 minutes and resuscitative
efforts should be initiated
ii. Survival is not likely for submersion time greater than 90 minutes and clinicians
may consider not initiating resuscitation or termination of resuscitation on scene
b. If water temperature is greater than 43°F (6°C) and the patient is submerged
with evidence of cardiac arrest:
i. Survival is possible for submersion time less than 30 minutes and resuscitative
efforts should be initiated
ii. Survival is not likely for submersion time greater than 30 minutes and clinicians
may consider not initiating resuscitation or termination of resuscitation on scene
11. Patients may develop subacute respiratory difficulty after drowning and therefore all
victims of drowning should be transported for observation
12. Decompression illness may have a variety of presentations depending on system affected
(e.g., skin, joint(s), pulmonary, neurologic), and can occur even when a diver does not
exceed dive table limits

Dive (SCUBA) Injury/Accidents
Aliases
Barotrauma

Bends

Squeeze

Patient Care Goals
1. Rapid assessment and management of life-threatening injuries
2. Rescue from the water-based environment
3. Transport patients suffering from self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA)
diving injury/illness for hospital evaluation and consideration of repressurization/hyperbaric
oxygen therapy (HBOT)
Patient Presentation
Inclusion Criteria
Patients with history of recent (within 48 hours) SCUBA diving activity who are exhibiting potential
signs and/or symptoms of dive related illness/injury, regardless of dive table compliance. NOTE:
SCUBA-related complications may occur anywhere, particularly when divers travel by air within
24-hours of diving
Exclusion Criteria
Patients without history of recent (within 48 hours) SCUBA diving exposure
Patient Management
Assessment
1. History should include circumstances leading to the complaint, details of mechanism of injury,
time under water, depth of dive, compliance with dive tables/decompression stops, gas
mixture used, and water temperature (if available)
2. Be alert for signs of barotrauma (pulmonary barotrauma, arterial gas embolism,
pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, ear/sinus/dental barotrauma, dysrhythmias, skin
mottling or erythema, neurologic signs and symptoms etc.) and/or decompression sickness
(joint pain, mental status change, other neurologic symptoms including paralysis) or nitrogen
narcosis (confusion, intoxication).
3. Assess for other associated injury such as injury to the head or spine (if mechanism and
symptoms suggest), marine envenomation, hypothermia, or other injury
Treatment and Interventions
1. If a SCUBA accident includes associated drowning/near-drowning [See Drowning Guideline]
2. Manage airway as indicated and provide 100% oxygen
3. If air embolism suspected, place in left lateral recumbent position (patient lying with the
left side down, knees drawn upward, and flat)
a. Trendelenburg position is sometimes recommended to help trap the air in the
dependent right ventricle, and may be useful if a central venous catheter is being
used to withdraw the air, but this position may increase cerebral edema
4. Monitor vital signs including oxygen saturations and cardiac rhythm (if possible)
5. Administer oxygen as appropriate with a target of achieving 94–98% saturation

a. Use positive pressure ventilation (e.g., CPAP) carefully in patients for whom
pulmonary barotrauma is a consideration [See Airway Management Guideline] and if
signs or symptoms of tension pneumothorax are present perform needle decompression
6. Patients with symptoms suspicious for decompression illness, should be placed
on supplemental oxygen regardless of saturations to enhance washout of inert
gasses
7. Assess for hypothermia, treat per Hypothermia/Cold Exposure Guideline
8. Consider contacting medical direction and discussing need for hyperbaric treatment and
primary transport to facility with hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) capability — include
discussion regarding factors such as submersion time, greatest depth achieved, ascent
rate, and gas mix
9. Establish IV access
10. Fluid bolus as indicated
Patient Safety Considerations
1. If the patient is still in the water, seek safest and most rapid means of removal safe (within
your scope of training) while minimizing risk of further injury
2. Seek assistance early for special rescue/extrication and transportation needs
3. Check for multiple patients (e.g., group dive table calculation error(s) or contaminated dive
gases)
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. Rescue efforts should be coordinated between all responding agencies to ensure that the
patient is rapidly accessed and safely removed from the water if diver unable to do so
themselves
2. If air medical transport is necessary, the patient should be transported with the cabin
pressurized to lowest possible altitude. If an unpressurized aircraft is used (i.e., most
helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS)), patient should be flown at the lowest safe
altitude possible
3. Decompression illness may have a variety of presentations depending on system affected
(e.g., skin, joint(s), pulmonary, neurologic)
4. SCUBA accidents/incidents can result in a variety of issues, including barotrauma, air
embolism and decompression illness
5. Decompression illness may have a variety of presentations depending on system affected
(e.g., skin, joint(s), pulmonary, neurologic), and can occur even when a diver does not exceed
dive table limits
6. Do not attempt to disassemble, turn off, or modify any of the dive equipment. The dive
computer may provide a clue about the patient’s exposure to depth
Pertinent Assessment Findings
1. Vital signs findings
2. Neurologic status assessment findings
3. Respiratory assessment findings (i.e., oxygen saturation, respiratory rate)
4. Subcutaneous emphysema

Altitude Illness
Aliases
Acute mountain sickness (AMS)
High altitude cerebral edema (HACE)

Altitude sickness
High altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE)

Definitions
1. Acute mountain sickness: Headache plus one or more of the following: anorexia, nausea
or vomiting, fatigue or weakness, dizziness or lightheadedness or difficulty sleeping. (In
infants and young children, symptoms include pallor, fussiness, vomiting, decreased
appetite, poor sleep, decreased playfulness.) These symptoms must occur in the setting
of recent arrival to high altitude (generally considered greater than 5000 – 7000 feet)
2. High altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE): Progressive dyspnea, cough, hypoxia, and
weakness in high altitude environments (considered greater than 8000 feet). (In infants
and young children, symptoms again include pallor, fussiness, vomiting, decreased
appetite, poor sleep, decreased playfulness.) Patients may or may not exhibit new
symptoms if acute mountain sickness precedes symptoms of HAPE
3. High altitude cerebral edema (HACE): Heralded by mental status changes in patients with
symptoms of acute mountain sickness including altered mentation, ataxia, or stupor and
progressing to coma. Typically seen in high altitude environments (greater than 8000 feet)
4. Feet to meters conversion reference:

Version 3.0

Patient Management
Assessment
Assessment should target the signs and symptoms of altitude illness but should also consider
alternate causes of these symptoms
Treatment and Interventions
1. Ensure scene safety for rescuers
2. Stop ascent
a. Patients with acute mountain sickness only may remain at their current altitude
and initiate symptomatic therapy
b. Patients with HACE or HAPE should initiate descent
3. Perform ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) and manage airway as necessary
4. Administer supplemental oxygen, if available, with goal to keep oxygen saturations 90%
5. Descend to lower altitude. Descent is the mainstay of therapy and is the definitive
therapy for all altitude related illnesses. Descent should be initiated as soon as scene
conditions permit
a. If severe respiratory distress is present and pulmonary edema is found on
exam, clinician should start positive pressure ventilation
b. Establish IV and perform fluid bolus with goal to maintain systolic BP greater than 90
mmHg
c. Monitor cardiac rhythm
6. Descent should always be the primary treatment strategy for patients suffering from
altitude illness, especially patients suffering from HACE and HAPE. If decent is not
possible, or if medical direction permits, the EMS clinician may consider the following
possible therapies — portable hyperbaric chambers are effective for the management of
severe altitude illness. However, they should not be used in lieu of decent, only as an
alternative should descent be unfeasible.
a. Acute mountain sickness
i. Ibuprofen or acetaminophen for pain [See Pain Management Guideline]
ii. Ondansetron 4 mg IV, PO, or sublingual every 6 hours for vomiting [See NauseaVomiting Guideline]
iii. Acetazolamide: up to 250 mg PO twice a day
1. Pediatric dosing is 2.5 mg/kg to a maximum of 125 mg, given twice a day
2. Acetazolamide speeds acclimatization and therefore helps in treating acute
mountain sickness
iv. Dexamethasone 4 mg IM, IV, or PO q 6 hours until symptoms resolve
1. Pediatric dosing is 0.15 mg/kg IM, IV, or PO q 6 hours; maximum single dose is 4
mg.
2. Dexamethasone helps treat the symptoms of acute mountain sickness and
may be used as an adjunctive therapy in severe acute mountain sickness when
the above measures alone do not ameliorate the symptoms. In these
circumstances, patients should also initiate descent, as dexamethasone does
not facilitate acclimatization
b. HACE: All therapies listed below should be considered as adjunctive to descent.
Descent should always be the primary treatment modality
i. Dexamethasone: 8 mg IM, IV, or PO once followed by 4 mg q 6 hours
1. Pediatric dosing: 0.15 mg/kg/dose every 6 hours

2. Dexamethasone helps treat the symptoms of HACE and should be initiated in
HACE. In these circumstances, patients should also initiate descent
ii. Consider use of acetazolamide at the above dosing
c. HAPE: All therapies listed below should be considered as adjunctive to descent.
Descent should always be the primary treatment modality
i. Nifedipine: Adult 30 mg ER (extended-release) PO twice a day. Pediatric: 0.5 mg/kg
(max single dose 20 mg), extended-release PO every 8 hours
ii. If nifedipine is not available:
iii. Tadalafil: 10 mg PO twice daily may be used
OR
i. Sildenafil: 50 mg PO three times a day may be used
ii. Multiple pulmonary vasodilators should not be used concurrently
Patient Safety Considerations
1. The high-altitude environment is inherently dangerous. Rescuers must balance
patient needs with patient safety and safety for the responders
2. Rapid descent by a minimum of 500–1000 feet is a priority, however rapidity of
descent must be balanced by current environmental conditions and other safety
considerations
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. Patients suffering from altitude illness have exposed themselves to a dangerous
environment. By entering the same environment, clinicians are exposing themselves to
the same altitude exposure. Be vigilant in looking for symptoms of altitude illness
amongst rescuers
2. Descent of 500–1000 feet is often enough to see improvements in patient conditions
3. Patients with HAPE are suffering from non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema and may
benefit from positive pressure ventilation via either bag assisted ventilation, CPAP, or
other means of positive pressure ventilation
4. Patients suffering from altitude illness are commonly dehydrated and require IV fluids —
once resuscitation is complete and the patient requires no further fluid boluses, maintain
IV fluids at 125 mL/hr
5. HAPE is the most lethal of all altitude illnesses
6. Consider alternate causes of symptoms of AMS — the symptoms of AMS may be caused
by alternate etiologies such as carbon monoxide poisoning (in patients cooking within
enclosed areas), dehydration, exhaustion, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia
7. Children with the following are at greater risk for altitude illness:
a. Those with a concurrent upper or lower respiratory tract infection or otitis media.
b. Full term infants less than 6 weeks of age, or preterm infants less than 46 weeks post
conceptual age
c. Congenital heart disease
d. Down syndrome, especially those with obstructive sleep apnea
e. Those with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia,
severe scoliosis, and neuromuscular diseases
f. Premature infants beyond 46-weeks with a history of oxygen requirement, PBD or
pulmonary hypertension

g. Children who live at high altitude when they descend to lower altitude, then return
home are at risk for HAPE
Pertinent Assessment Findings

2. HAPE will present with increasing respiratory distress and rales on exam
3. HACE will present with mental status changes, ataxia, and progressing to coma

Patient Care Goals
1. Manage the condition that triggered the application of the conducted electrical weapon with
special attention to patients meeting criterion for delirium with agitated behavior [See
Agitated or Violent Patient/Behavioral Emergency Guideline ]
2. Ensure patient is appropriately secured or restrained with assistance of law enforcement to
protect the patient and clinicians [See Agitated or Violent Patient/Behavioral Emergency
Guideline]
3. Perform comprehensive trauma and medical assessment for injuries (e.g., from falls or
altercations or concomitant medical issues)
4. If discharged from a distance, up to two single barbed darts (13 mm length) should be located
a. Do not remove barbed dart from sensitive areas (head, neck, hands, feet, or
genitals)
Patient Presentation
Inclusion Criteria
1. Patient received either a weapon’s direct-contact discharge or struck by the barbed dart of a
conducted electrical weapon
2. Patient may have sustained fall or physical confrontation trauma
3. Patient may be under the influence of toxic substances and or may have underlying medical or
psychiatric disorder
Exclusion Criteria
None noted
Patient Management
Assessment
1. Once patient has been appropriately secured or restrained with assistance of law
enforcement, perform primary and secondary assessment including 3-lead EKG, pulse
oximeter, and consider 12-lead EKG
2. Evaluate patient for evidence of delirium with agitated behavior manifested by varied
combination of agitation, reduced pain sensitivity, elevated temperature, persistent
struggling, or hallucinosis
Treatment and Interventions
1. Make sure patient is appropriately secured with assistance of law enforcement to protect the
patient and staff. Consider psychologic management medications if patient struggling against
physical devices and may harm themselves or others
2. Some EMS agencies treat all barbed darts as a foreign body and leave them for physician
removal while others allow EMS or law enforcement to remove barbed darts except for

sensitive areas (head, neck, hands, feet, or genitals). Follow local protocols, including those of
law enforcement for evidence collection and retention.
3. Treat medical and traumatic injury
Patient Safety Considerations
1. Before removal of the barbed dart, make sure the cartridge has been removed from the
conducted electrical weapon
2. Patient should not be restrained in the prone, face down, or hog-tied position as respiratory
compromise is a significant risk
3. The patient may have underlying pathology before being tased (refer to appropriate
guidelines for managing the underlying medical/traumatic pathology)
4. Perform a comprehensive assessment with special attention looking for signs and symptoms
of active medical decompensation
5. Transport the patient to the hospital
6. EMS clinicians who respond for a conducted electrical weapon patient should not perform a
"medical clearance" for law enforcement to then take the patient to a nonmedical facility
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. Conducted electrical weapon can be discharged in three fashions:
a. Direct contact without the use of the darts
b. A single dart with addition contact by direct contact of weapon
c. From a distance up to 35 feet with two darts
2. The device delivers 19 pulses per second with an average current per pulse of 2.1
milliamps which, in combination with toxins/drugs, patient's underlying diseases,
excessive physical exertion, and trauma, may precipitate arrhythmias. Thus, consider
cardiac monitoring and 12-lead EKG assessment
3. Drive Stun is a direct weapon two-point contact which is designed to generate pain and
not incapacitate the subject. Only local muscle groups are stimulated with the Drive Stun
technique
Pertinent Assessment Findings
1. Thoroughly assess the patient for trauma as the patient may have fallen from standing or
higher
2. Ascertain if more than one TASER® cartridge was used (by one or more officers, in effort
to identify total number of possible darts and contacts)

Electrical Injuries
Aliases
Electrical burns

Electrocution

Patient Care Goals
1. Prevent additional harm to patient
2. Identify life threatening issues such as dysrhythmias and cardiac arrest
3. Identify characteristics of electrical source to communicate to receiving facility
(voltage, amperage, alternating current [AC] versus direct current [DC])
4. Understand that deep tissue injury can be far greater than external appearance
5. Have high index of suspicion for associated trauma due to patient being thrown
6. Determine most appropriate disposition for the patient as many will require burn
center care and some may require trauma center care
Patient Presentation
Inclusion Criteria
Exposure to electrical current (AC or DC).
Exclusion Criteria
None noted
Patient Management
Assessment
1. Verify scene is secure. The electrical source must be disabled prior to assessment
2. Perform primary survey with specific focus on dysrhythmias or cardiac arrest—apply a
continuous cardiac monitor and obtain 12-lead EKG as soon as feasible
3. Identify all sites of burn injury. If the patient became part of the circuit, there will be an
additional site near the contact with ground. Electrical burns are often full thickness and
involve significant deep tissue damage, and there may be multiple burn sites
4. Assess for potential associated trauma and note if the patient was thrown from contact point.
If patient has altered mental status, assume trauma was involved and treat accordingly
5. Assess for potential compartment syndrome from significant extremity tissue damage
6. Determine characteristics of source if possible (AC or DC, voltage, amperage, time of injury)
Treatment and Interventions
1. Identify dysrhythmias or cardiac arrest — even patients who appear dead (particularly dilated
pupils) may have good outcomes with prompt intervention [see appropriate guideline for
additional information and patient assessment/treatment]
2. Apply spinal motion restriction if associated trauma suspected [See Trauma Section]
3. Apply dry dressing to any wounds
4. Remove constricting clothing and jewelry since additional swelling is possible
5. Administer IV fluid resuscitation. Remember that external appearance will underestimate the
degree of tissue injury but that electrical injuries do not generally require as much fluid as
thermal burn injuries

6. Electrical injuries may be associated with significant pain, treat per Pain Management
Guideline
7. Electrical injury patients should be taken to a burn center whenever possible since these
injuries can involve considerable tissue damage
8. When there is significant associated trauma, this takes priority, if local trauma resources and
burn resources are not in the same facility
Patient Safety Considerations
1. Verify no additional threat to patient
2. Shut off electrical power
3. Move patient to shelter if electrical storm activity still in area
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. Electrical current causes injury through three main mechanisms:
a. Direct tissue damage, altering cell membrane resting potential, and eliciting tetany
in skeletal and/or cardiac muscles
b. Conversion of electrical energy into thermal energy, causing massive tissue
destruction and coagulative necrosis
c. Mechanical injury with direct trauma resulting from falls or violent muscle contraction
2. Anticipate atrial and/or ventricular dysrhythmias as well as cardiac arrest
3. The mortality related to electrical injuries is impacted by several factors:
a. Route current takes through the body- current traversing the heart has
higher mortality
b. Type of current (AC vs. DC)
i. AC is more likely to cause cardiac dysrhythmias while DC is more likely to cause
deep tissue burns however either type of current can cause any injury
ii. DC typically causes one muscle contraction while AC can cause repeated
contractions
iii. Both types of current can cause involuntary muscle contractions that do not
allow the victim to let go of the electrical source
iv. AC is more likely to cause ventricular fibrillation while DC is more likely to cause
asystole
c. The amount of current impacts mortality more than the voltage

Lightning/Lightning Strike Injury
Aliases
Lightning burn
Patient Care Goals
1. Identify patient(s) as lightning strike victim(s)
2. Move to safe area
3. Initiate immediate resuscitation of cardiac arrest victim(s), within limits of mass casualty care,
also known as "reverse triage"
4. Cardiac monitoring during transport
5. Treat associated traumatic injuries
Patient Presentation
1. Lightning strikes may happen in a variety of environmental conditions
a. Most commonly they occur in outdoor or wilderness circumstances
b. Golf courses, exposed mountains or ledges and farms/fields all present conditions
that increase risk of lightning strike, when hazardous meteorological conditions exist
2. Lacking bystander observations or history, it is not always immediately apparent
that patient has been the victim of a lightning strike
Subtle findings such as injury patterns might suggest lightning injury
Inclusion Criteria

Version 3.0

i. Anxiety
j. Fixed/dilated pupils possible (autonomic dysfunction)
Skin
a. Ferning or fern-like superficial skin burn ("Lichtenberg figures")
b. Vascular instability may result in cool, mottled extremities
c. Frequent first and/or second-degree burns
d. Third degree burns less common
Patient may be in full cardiopulmonary arrest or have only respiratory arrest, as injury is
a result of DC current
May have stroke-like findings as a result of neurologic insult
May have secondary traumatic injury as a result of overpressurization, blast or missile injury
Fixed/dilated pupils may be a sign of neurologic insult, rather than a sign of
death/impending death. Should not be used as a solitary, independent sign of death for the
purpose of discontinuing resuscitation in this patient population

Treatment and Interventions
1. Assure patent airway — if in respiratory arrest only, manage airway as appropriate
2. If in cardiopulmonary arrest, treat per Cardiac Arrest Guideline
3. Consider IV initiation — avoid initiation through burned skin
4. Monitor EKG. Be alert for potential arrhythmias. Consider 12-lead EKG, when available
5. Consider early pain management for burns or associated traumatic injury [See Pain
Management Guideline]
Patient Safety Considerations
1. Recognize that repeat strike is a risk. Patient and rescuer safety is paramount
2. Victims do not carry or discharge a current, so the patient is safe to touch and treat
Notes/Educational Pearls
Key Considerations
1. Lightning strike cardiopulmonary arrest patients have a high rate of successful
resuscitation, if initiated early, in contrast to general cardiac arrest statistics
2. There may be multiple victims
3. If multiple victims, cardiac arrest patients whose injury was witnessed or thought to be
recent should be treated first and aggressively (reverse from traditional triage
practices)
a. Patients suffering cardiac arrest from lightning strike initially suffer a combined
cardiac and respiratory arrest
b. Return of spontaneous circulation may precede resolution of respiratory arrest
c. Patients may be successfully resuscitated if provided proper cardiac and
respiratory support, highlighting the value of "reverse triage"
4. It may not be immediately apparent that the patient is a lightning strike victim
5. Injury pattern and secondary physical exam findings may be key in identifying patient as
a victim of lightning strike
6. Lightning strike is a result of very high voltage, very short duration DC current exposure

NEMSIS, Documentation
Patient Care Goals
1. Support continuity of patient care and continuous performance improvement (CPI) of
patient care through meeting minimum documentation standards for all EMS events where
a patient was encountered
2. This guideline defines minimum standards and inclusions used and referenced throughout
this document under the “Quality Improvement” section of each guideline
3. The National EMS Information System (NEMSIS) submission requirements, state and local
EMS systems, and EMS billing reimbursement services will have more extensive minimum
requirements that exceed this guideline (For additional information, go to www.nemsis.org)
4. This guideline can be used as a starting point for systems looking to more formally define
documentation requirements

for each component, meaning a single exam finding of paralysis for an arm would take
ten steps to enter) and the same information is often reflected in the clinician’s
narrative.
b. However, there is some utility in targeted use of these fields for certain situations such
as stroke, spinal exams, and trauma without needing to enter all the fields in each
record.
Capacity Assessment Group
This can be used to support documentation of patient capacity for refusal of care and/or
transport, participation in advanced spinal assessments, or support for treatment decisions
by EMS clinicians. NOTE: The Capacity Assessment Group does not provide a legal definition
of capacity and should not be used as such. It is intended only to assist the EMS clinician in
documenting the most basic exam and history findings in order to determine capacity. Many
additional factors must be considered when determining capacity including the situation,
patient medical history, medical conditions, and consultation with medical direction.

The exam fields have many useful values for documenting trauma (deformity, bleeding,
burns, etc.). Use of targeted documentation of injured areas can be helpful, particularly in
cases of more serious trauma. Because of the endless possible variations where this could
be used, specific fields will not be defined here. Note, however that the exam fields use a
specific and useful Pertinent Negative called “Exam Finding Not Present.” This can be used
to document that the clinician actually performed the assessment but did not find any
injury/abnormality.

Narrative
The use of the narrative is essential to an effective and complete Patient Care Record. It
summarizes the incident history and care in a manner that is easily digested between caregivers
for continuity of care and provides a place for EMS to document facts that do not fit into fixed
data fields [see Narrative Section under Notes/Educational Pearls (below) for more detail]
Notes/Educational Pearls
Documenting Signs and Symptoms Versus Clinician Impressions
1. Signs and Symptoms
a. Signs and Symptoms should support the clinician impressions, treatment guidelines and
overall care given. A symptom is something the patient experiences and tells the clinician; it
is subjective. A sign is something the clinician sees; it is objective.
b. Symptoms should not be confused with clinician impressions. The clinician impressions
are the EMS working field diagnosis of the patient’s actual medical condition.
2. Clinician Impressions
a. There is often a great deal of confusion on the part of EMS clinicians about the
difference between symptoms and clinician impressions. Clinician impressions should be
supported by symptoms but not be the symptoms except on rare occasions where they
may be the same (i.e., weakness when no etiology for the weakness can be determined
by the EMS clinician).
b. Correctly documenting impressions is essential to many aspects of EMS data use, such
as EMS reimbursement, reports of incident types, specialty registries (e.g., CARES) and
CPI reviews. EMS agencies could literally lose money or equipment and staffing
resources if the clinicians are incorrectly entering clinician impressions. Addressing this
issue should be an essential part of the record Quality Assurance and CPI process and
documentation training.
c. Example of documenting symptoms versus impressions:
i. An opiate overdose patient who received naloxone and had a positive response.
This patient would have possible Symptoms of altered mental status, unconscious,
respiratory distress, and respiratory failure/apnea. All 4 of these symptoms are
available as clinician impressions, however the correct impression for this patient
would be whatever variation of “Drug Overdose Opiates or Heroin” impression(s)
are setup in the local ePCR system being used. This impression will specifically
define the call as an overdose with opiates, rather than a case where one of the
symptoms was also used as an impression when the use of naloxone and other
________________________

Rev. March 2022

NASEMSO
National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines

Version 3.0

assessments and diagnostic tools could not determine an etiology for the
symptom(s).
Narrative
The various data fields within the ePCR are important as they provide a means of uniformly
entering incident data that can be used for importing into billing software or hospital records,
transmitting between EMS systems or creating descriptive reports, or conducting research. In
most cases, at a local, state, or national level, if something wasn’t documented in the
appropriate data field, it didn’t happen or exist. However, the Narrative plays several essential
roles in the PCR.
1. Role of the Narrative
a. Provides an efficient and effective means to share patient information for continuity of
care between EMS services and EMS and hospital staff. The narrative summarizes the
incident history and care in a manner that is easily digested between caregivers.
b. Provides a place for EMS to document facts that do not fit into fixed data fields.
Specifically, this would include the detailed history of the scene, what the patient may
have done or said or other aspects of thecal that only the clinician saw, heard, or did.
The Narrative is the place for the EMS clinician to “paint the picture” for all others to
more fully understand the incident.
c. Provides a standard means to add essential details about medical history, exams,
treatments, patient response, and changes in patient condition that can’t otherwise be
effectively or clearly communicated.
2. Narrative Formats
Documentation by EMS clinicians demonstrates a wide variation of training and practice
reinforcement. Most training programs provide limited instruction on how to properly
document operational and clinical processes, and almost no practice. Most clinicians learn
this skill on the job, and often proficient mentors are sparse. Therefore, it is essential that
the EMS clinician uses a standard format to ensure they are consistent and complete in their
documentation. There are three standard formats for EMS documentation. EMS clinicians
should choose the best match for them, master the format, and be consistent in its use.
a. Medical Narrative: This format is the one most new EMS clinicians use as it is intuitive
and easy to learn. Some more experienced clinicians use it as they find telling the story
from start to finish works best to organize their thoughts. A drawback to this method is
that it is easy to forget to include facts because of the lack of structure.
b. SOAP: This format stands for Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan. This is a format
that is very common in the medical field.
c. CHART: This format stands for Complaint, History, Assessment, Rx (Treatment) and
Transport. Each section’s content is clearly defined and consistent in format. It
minimizes the likelihood of forgetting information and ensures documentation is
consistent between records and clinicians. CHART is the format most recommended as
best practice by EMS legal authorities and is considered the standard in many EMS
systems. A variation is DCHART, where the “D” stands for Dispatch (reason).
Medications Given Showing Positive Action Using Pertinent Negatives
For medications that are required by protocol (i.e., aspirin for cardiac chest pain), pertinent
negatives should be used to show that a medication protocol was considered but was satisfied
by other than clinician action.

National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines

Version 3.0

Example: EMS is called to a patient for cardiac chest pain. The patient has already taken 324 mg
of aspirin by the time EMS arrives per 911 pre-arrival instructions. EMS clinicians should
document this as a medication given, prior-to-arrival, with the best estimated time, and qualify
the medication as “Medication Already Taken” using the pertinent negative.
Definitions for Response to Medications
1. Improved:
a. The medication had its intended therapeutic effect and the patient's symptoms
decreased or clinical condition improved or resolved (the word "effective" could
generally be substituted for "improved").
b. If a patient had the intended therapeutic response to the medication, but a side effect
that caused a clinical deterioration in another body system, then "Improved" should be
chosen and the side effects documented as a complication (i.e., nitroglycerin improved
chest pain but dropped the blood pressure).
2. Unchanged:
a. The medication was ineffective and had no intended therapeutic effect or had a subtherapeutic and unnoticeable effect,
AND
b. The patient condition did not deteriorate.
3. Worse:
a. The patient condition deteriorated or continued to deteriorate because either the
medication:
i. Was ineffective and had no intended therapeutic effect;
OR
ii. Had a sub-therapeutic effect that was unable to stop or reverse the decline in
patient condition;
OR
iii. Was the wrong medication for the clinical situation and the therapeutic effect
caused the condition to worsen (i.e., giving glucose to a patient with
hyperglycemia/diabetic ketoacidosis).
Definitions for Response to Procedures
1. Not Applicable:
The nature of the procedure has no direct expected clinical response (i.e., patient
assessment, 12-lead EKG acquisition).
2. Improved:
a. The procedure performed had the intended effective outcome and/or the patient's
symptoms decreased, or clinical condition improved or resolved (i.e., defibrillation
resolved VF into a perfusing rhythm; intubation controlled the airway and allowed
effective management of breathing).
b. An effective procedure that caused an improvement in the patient condition may also
have resulted in a procedure complication and the complication should be documented
(i.e., intubation caused minor airway trauma, but the intubation successfully secured
the airway).
3. Unchanged:
a. The procedure performed did not have the clinical effect intended, but did not directly
worsen the patient's symptoms or clinical condition (i.e., attempted defibrillation and

Version 3.0

the person remained in VF);
or
b. Had a sub-therapeutic effect and the symptoms continued (i.e., a bandage applied to a
bleeding wound failed to stop the bleeding);
or
c. The nature of the procedure has no direct expected clinical response (i.e., patient
assessment).
NOTE: "Not Applicable" would also be appropriate to choose for these cases
4. Worse:
a. The results of the procedure performed lead to a worsening of the patient's symptoms
or condition (e.g., defibrillation converted VF into asystole, application of a splint caused
significant increase in pain or loss of sensation and pulses).
b. In the case of worsening condition, documentation of the procedure complications may
also be appropriate.
c. NOTE: Just because a patient got worse, doesn’t necessarily mean the clinician
performed the procedure incorrectly.
NEMSIS Data Standards and Limitations
1. NEMSIS is a national dataset and standard used by all EMS software systems. (For additional
information, go to www.nemsis.org.) Currently there are three versions of the data standard
available for documentation and in which data is stored:
a. NEMSIS Version 2.2.1 (v2.2.1)
i. Adopted in 2006, there have been no changes since release
ii. Most states or systems have used this standard since its release, and the majority of
most states’ data available since approximately 2016 is in this format.
iii. NEMSIS accepted v2.2.1 data through 12/31/2016, and some states may continue to
collect data in this standard until they transition to NEMSIS v3 standards.
b. NEMSIS Version 3 (v3)
i. NEMSIS v3 was created and finalized in 2011 to replace v2.2.1 in order to allow the
dataset to become more flexible for updates and adopt technical standards making
linkage to other health records possible.
1. NEMSIS v3.3.4 was released in March 2014 and was the first version in
production where live data was collected by services and states and
subsequently submitted to NEMSIS. NEMSIS will continue to accept v3.3.4 data
until 12/31/2017.
2. NEMSIS v3.4, released in March 2015, included both changed elements and
many added values to existing elements. NEMSIS has been accepting data from
this version concurrently with V3.3.4 data. As of August 2021, v3.4 will be the
only standard and V3.3.4 will be phased out. All documentation guidelines
found in this document are based on the NEMSIS v3.4 dataset and standard.
2. Mandatory and Required Elements
b. Mandatory: NEMSIS makes certain elements or fields mandatory so, if not included, the
record cannot be properly stored or moved electronically. These fields require real data
and do not accept Nil (Blank) values, Not Values, or Pertinent Negatives.
c. Required: NEMSIS requires these elements or fields to be completed or the record
cannot be properly stored or moved electronically. However, required fields allow Nil
(blank) values, Not Values, or Pertinent Negatives to be entered and submitted.

Version 3.0

d. State and local systems may have Mandatory or Required fields that are not Mandatory
or Required by NEMSIS. The manager for these systems should be contacted for a list of
these fields.
3. Not Values, Nil, and Pertinent Negatives
b. Not Values (NV), Nil, and Pertinent Negatives (PN) are values that are attributes of
certain NEMSIS elements designed to clarify a null data entry or qualify data entry into
the element with which the NV, Nil, or PN is associated.
c. Not Values available are “Not Applicable” and “Not Recorded”
i. Some NEMSIS rules require one of these values to be entered when data is
imported/exported if there is no other data in a field (e.g., at least one medication
given must have a value, if no medications are given, then the software system must
insert “Not Applicable” in the medications field when exporting)
ii. At times the EMS clinician use of “Not Applicable” is appropriate documentation
(e.g., using “Not Applicable” under eInjury.03—Trauma Center Criteria, per the ACSCOT 2022 National Guideline for the Field Triage of Injured Patients, when
transporting a patient with a simple sprained ankle)
d. Nil Values are blank values
i. Values can be left blank, which can either be an accidental or purposeful omission of
data.
ii. Value fields can appropriately and purposefully be left blank if there was nothing to
enter (e.g., a procedure field left blank if no patient was encountered).
e. Pertinent Negatives are attributes or qualifiers for both elements and fields. There are
11 possible Pertinent Negative values and the available list for each field varies as
appropriate to the field. Two examples of the use of Pertinent Negatives are:
i. Documenting non-administration of ASA for chest pain by the EMS clinician with the
Pertinent Negative of “Medication Already Taken” to show evidence that this
treatment requirement was met.
ii. Documenting assessment of, and lack of a gunshot wound to the chest with the
qualifier of “Chest --> gunshot wound --> Exam Finding Not Present” in the
examination section (previously you could only document a positive finding of a
gunshot wound with was no way to document that you looked and did not find
one).
4. NEMSIS Element and Value Name Formats
b. NEMSIS Elements/Fields are organized into groups with other related elements/fields
i. There are two parent datasets: Demographic (designated by a “d”) and EMS
(designated by an “e”). The majority of the documentation in any ePCR falls in the
“e” section. The Demographic dataset is intended to be descriptive of the EMS
agencies and system characteristics for correlation at a larger research level, rather
than for use in operational CPI reviews.
ii. The element numbering structure reflects the dataset and the text group name of
the element
5. Example: “eVitals.06—SBP (Systolic Blood Pressure)” where “e” is the EMS dataset and
“Vitals” is the dataset grouping for all elements related to Vitals and the number is the
number assigned to a specific element.
b. “eVitals.06” is used to store the data in the background and “SBP (Systolic Blood
Pressure)” is what clinicians and reviewers see.
c. Values are designated by a code and text name.

i.

The codes are generally derived from various sources such as ICD-10, SNOMED, or
RxNorm and are used to store and move the data in the system’s background.
ii. Codes are not seen by the EMS clinician in the ePCR, but rather the clinician will see
text names.
Some software systems allow the visible text name to be modified or relabeled to
meet local standards or nomenclature; This feature can help improve data quality
by making documentation easier for the clinician.
iii. An example of a value code and name for cardiac chest pain, found under the
element “eProtocols.01—Protocols Used” is “9914117 – Medical-Cardiac Chest
Pain”.
d. All minimum general documentation guideline requirements are identified using the
NEMSIS element, values codes, and names to allow application across a variety of ePCR
software labels for these fields.
6. Custom Elements/Fields and Values
b. The NEMSIS Standard provides a data format for software vendors to create custom
elements or values requested by states or local systems.
c. States or local systems may create new elements or value extensions for existing
NEMSIS elements to meet regional needs (e.g., adding additional protocol name values
not on the NEMSIS list).
Airway Confirmation Fields
Specific use of the NEMSIS airway confirmation fields in documentation will not be detailed at
this time due to current operational and technical challenges all states, local systems, and ePCR
software vendors are experiencing.
The NEMSIS airway confirmation fields were closely modeled on the “Recommended Guidelines
for Uniform Reporting of Data from Out-of-Hospital Airway Management: Position Statement of
the National Association of EMS Physicians” and the fields and values could provide excellent
and appropriately useful data to evaluate airway management. However, the technical structure
of the fields has made their practical use limited as all the data is collected as a separate, selfcontained group, rather than as part of the procedures group. This means EMS clinicians would
need to enter much of the same information twice in the ePCR, in both the procedures area and
airway confirmation section (when, who did it, what device was used, and complications).
Furthermore, the airway group can only be entered once per ePCR, so the fields cannot be used
again if more than one airway was required (e.g., one airway became ineffective and needed to
be replaced with a different type of airway). Many states and ePCR software vendors have been
struggling with how to make these fields functional for use by only using a portion of them or
looking to add mirrored custom values that are directly linked to procedures performed.
However, solutions are currently far from practical, functional, effective, or uniform in how they
are being implemented or used across various systems.

III. Medications
The project team considered the use of Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) Tall Man Letters
methodology to avoid the miscommunication of lookalike drug names. Upon review of the list and the
limited number of medications carried by EMS, as well as the expected use of this document, it was
elected not to institute this measure into our medication list. We recommend EMS agencies consider
incorporating these measures into practice where appropriate.

Parkland Formula
For patients who require fluid resuscitation, consider use of the Parkland formula to calculate
the volume of normal saline or lactated Ringer’s solution that should be administered
intravenously to ensure hemodynamic stability.
Volume of Intravenous Fluid required in the first 24 hours (in mL) =
(4 X patient weight in kg) X (Percentage of total body surface area burned)
The first half of the volume of fluid should be administered over the first 8 hours following the
burn with the remaining fluid administered over the following 16 hours.
For pediatric patients, a weight-based assessment tool (length-based tape or other system)
should be used to provide a more accurate estimate of the patient’s weight. Likewise, the total
body surface area (BSA) estimates are different for pediatric patients compared to adults due to
larger head and trunk size. For children, the palmar surface of the hand (not including the
fingers is approximately equal to 1% BSA. The guidelines listed above will provide assistance
during the estimation of the percentage of total body surface area burned for patients of
various ages and body habitus.

VI. Neurologic Status Assessment
Neurologic status assessment involves establishing a baseline and then trending any change in patient
neurologic status. Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) is frequently used, but there are often errors in applying
and calculating this score. With this in consideration, Glasgow Coma Score may not be more valid than a
simpler field approach. Either AVPU (Alert, Verbal, Painful, Unresponsive) or only the motor component
of the GCS may more effectively serve in this capacity.

VIII. Evidence-Based Guidelines: GRADE Methodology
An Overview of GRADE Methodology
Although engagement in quality EMS research has increased significantly, the demand for evidencebased quality prehospital research continues to exceed its availability. The need for evidence-based
prehospital patient care protocols was clearly recognized by the Institute of Medicine of the
National Academies and clearly stated in 2007 in The Future of Emergency Care: Emergency Medical
Services at the Crossroads.
The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE)
methodology is a transparent process where the available research is reviewed and assessed by a
panel of subject matter experts. Following this thorough review process, the available research is
reviewed and graded for its validity based upon the assessment of the workgroup, and an evidencebased guideline (EBG) is developed based upon the outcome of the workgroup.
The Federal Interagency Committee on Emergency Medical Services (FICEMS) and the National EMS
Advisory Council (NEMSAC) approved a National Prehospital Evidence-based Guideline Model
Process for the development, implementation, and evaluation of evidence-based guidelines. This
Model Process recommends the use of the GRADE methodology for the guideline development tool.
The six process steps of the GRADE EBG development tool are:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Assemble the expert panel and provide GRADE training
Define the EBG content area and establish the specific clinical questions to address in patient,
intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) format
Prioritize outcomes to facilitate systematic literature searches
Create GRADE tables (or evidence profiles) for each PICO question
Vet and endorse GRADE evidence tables and draft recommendations
Synthesize recommendations into an EMS protocol and visual algorithm

Some evidence-based guidelines cited in this document were created for and released by NHTSA;
however, the GRADE methodology is not proprietary to NHTSA or any other organization. Local,
regional, and state EMS agencies and EMS systems are encouraged to support the ongoing need for
quality prehospital care, improved patient outcome, and the growing demand for EBGs for EMS.
