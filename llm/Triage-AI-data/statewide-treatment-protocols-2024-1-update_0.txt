SECTION 1:

GENERAL
PATIENT CARE







Statewide Treatment Protocols 
Version 2024.1

1.0 Routine Patient Care
NOTE: This protocol applies to all EMS calls.

RESPOND TO SCENE IN A SAFE MANNER:
* Review dispatch information. 
* Use lights and sirens and/or pre-emptive devices when responding as appropriate per emergency medical dispatch information and local guidelines. 

SCENE ARRIVAL AND SIZE-UP: 
* Utilize Body Substance Isolation (BSI), and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) as appropriate. 
* Assess scene safety, bystander safety. 
*  Assess for weapons of mass destruction (WMD), odors/fumes, cultural/social factors, active shooter hostile event response (ASHER), and environmental hazards, as applicable. 
* Determine number of patients. 
* Determine need for additional/specialized resources.
* Utilize Mass Casualty Incident (MCI) and/or Incident Command System (ICS) procedures, as necessary.
* Determine nature of illness/ mechanism of injury (NOI/MOI).

PATIENT APPROACH: 
* The presumption is that patients requesting EMS services should not walk to the stretcher or ambulance but should be moved using safe and proper lifts and devices.  Specifically, the condition of patients with cardiac, respiratory, or neurological conditions, and of patients with unstable vital signs, can be worsened by exertion, so patient effort in moving to the stretcher and ambulance should be minimized.  Unique circumstances and deviations from these principles must be clearly described in the Patient Care Report (PCR) and the service must have an internal performance improvement (PI) mechanism to review each case.  
* DO NOT allow sick or injured patients to walk or otherwise exert themselves. Use safe and proper lifts and carries and appropriate devices to extricate patients to the ambulance stretcher.
* Begin assessment and care at the side of the patient; avoid delay. 
* Bring all necessary equipment to the patient in order to function at your level of certification and up to the level of the ambulance service license.  
* Activate air-medical transport early and if applicable to do so.
* Determine if a valid MOLST order or Comfort Care/DNR Verification form is in place, and act accordingly.
*  Form a general impression of patient acuity, determine patient priority, and request advanced life support (ALS) if appropriate. 
   *      Note that there is no such regulatory concept as a "lift-assist call."  Under 105 CMR 170.345 of the
       EMS System Regulations, each EMS call - including but not limited to those cases in which no 
       treatment is provided, the patient refuses treatment and there is no transport - a patient care  
       report (PCR) must be documented.  When EMS is dispatched to a patient who is requesting a "lift  
       assist," EMS must complete and document an appropriate patient assessment on a PCR.  If the  
       patient is not transported, then an informed refusal must be documented, in accordance with
       Protocol 7.5 Refusal of Medical Care and Transportation and included in the PCR.




ASSESSMENT AND TREATMENT PRIORITIES 
*      Determine unresponsiveness, absence of breathing and pulselessness; initiate high quality CPR with 
       minimal interruptions in chest compressions for patients found to be in cardiac arrest and in the  
       absence of a MOLST/CC/DNR.  
*    Determine patient's hemodynamic stability, signs and symptoms, level of consciousness, vital signs to        include airway, breathing circulation, disabilities/differential diagnosis, exposure/environmental (ABCDE).
*       Identify/manage life threats, maintain an open airway and assist ventilation as needed.
*       Apply the cardiac monitor and obtain a 12-lead ECG tracing as soon as possible when clinically  
        appropriate and within your scope of practice.
*      Administer supplemental oxygen using the appropriate delivery device, if indicated.  When using a    BVM on pediatric patients, the BVM should deliver PEEP at 5mm/H2O.  
* If in your scope of practice, obtain peripheral access via intravenous (IV) or intraosseous (IO) on all patients exhibiting signs and symptoms consistent with shock or who are hemodynamically compromised, or have the potential to become compromised.  For pediatric patients, a 20mL/kg fluid bolus if applicable.    
* When obtaining IO access in patients able to perceive pain, in adults, administer Lidocaine 40mg over two minutes, followed by a 10mL fluid bolus over five seconds. In pediatrics, 1mg/kg to a maximum of 20mg.  
* Patients who may be in need of medications for conditions such as, but not limited to, nausea or pain should also have IV access established, if possible, to do so.
*      In a critical patient with no other vascular access, if trained to do so and with concurrent on-line   
medical control (OLMC) order (OLMC need not be contacted for a patient in cardiac arrest), Paramedics may access a Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC) line, tunneled and non-tunneled externally accessible central catheters, in order to administer fluids or medications. 
*      If basic life support (BLS) airway management is not sufficient, consider the use of advanced airway       interventions as appropriate and if trained to do so and time allows.
*      Ventilation rates are to be titrated to goal end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) recommendations.
*      Use quantitative, recordable waveform capnography for all patients with advanced airway  
       interventions and consider its use with all respiratory compromised conditions.
*     The capnography waveform must be recorded on all intubated patients and clinically significant data   
      attached to the patient care report for the receiving facility.  In patients who are not in cardiac arrest, all efforts should be made to avoid end-tidal carbon dioxide levels that have been shown to be detrimental and to ensure quality ventilation and oxygenation.  In general, this means that capno-ETCO2 values should be kept between 35-45 mm Hg in these patients; specific exceptions should be discussed with online medical control. 
*     At a minimum, monitor and document vital signs every 15 minutes on stable patients and every 5  
      minutes for patients with critical conditions. 
*    Conduct a thorough assessment of the present illness or injury; onset, provocation, quality, radiation, severity, time (O-P-Q-R-S-T.)
*    Obtain a complete medical history; signs/symptoms, allergies, medication, past medical history, last in and out, events leading up to and risk factors (S-A-M-P-L-E-R).
*    Obtain venous blood samples according to the receiving hospital policies.
*    Obtain additional field diagnostic testing when clinically indicated, and if available; (not limited to)  
     blood glucose, pulse oximetry, temperature, carbon monoxide, stroke scale.
*    Administer medications in accordance with the specific patient condition and scope of practice. 
*    Contact OLMC for all procedures outside the provisions of standing orders, which may  
     include repeat doses of medications within the standing orders.
*    Follow service or regional policies for all radio or communication failures.
*    If indicated, contact the receiving hospital to provide a clear and concise report on the patient's  
     condition, all interventions, findings, and estimated time of arrival to the receiving department. 
*    Continually reassess all patients, especially after any interventions and/or medication administration.  
*    EMS crews should not begin or administer interventions that would require medical assessment if a  
     patient is being brought to an environment where formal medical assessment will not be provided; for  
     example, giving IV narcotics to a patient who is about to be left at home. 
*    Based on EMS assessment, a patient may qualify to be treated under multiple treatment protocols.
*    Pediatric patients shall be defined as those patients who weigh up to 40kg or are 14 years of age or       younger, whichever comes first, and unless specified in the particular protocol.

AMBULANCE STRETCHER OPERATIONS
* Operate the ambulance stretcher in accordance with your service training and manufacturer's specifications at all times.
* When moving a patient on the ambulance stretcher, adjust the height of the ambulance stretcher from the "load position" to a safe position for travel.
* All EMTs moving the patient must keep both hands on the ambulance cot when elevated or in motion. Properly secure all patients using the required straps, including the over-the-shoulder harness, hip and leg restraining straps.
* If patient care requires the removal of any of the restraining straps, re-secure them as soon as practical to do so. 
* Pediatric patients are to be transported in a properly secured child transport device/seat if spinal injury is not suspected (See 7.4 Pediatric Transport for more).

PATIENT CARE REPORTS AND DATA COLLECTION
* The EMS System regulations require an accurate, concise and properly documented patient care report to be completed at the time of the call or as soon as practicable afterwards for all patient encounters. Pertinent data must be left at the receiving hospital at the time of transport. The regulations also require that patient care reports include the minimum required data elements, as defined by Administrative Requirement (AR) 5-403. 
* Note that EMS personnel dispatched to an EMS call in a certified ambulance vehicle of any class (Class I through V) must always complete an appropriately documented patient care report. This is required under 105 CMR 170.345 of the EMS System regulations. See last bullet under Patient Approach, above.
* Clinically relevant data must be conveyed to an appropriate clinical representative of the receiving institution before leaving the receiving facility, ideally using a structured hand-off method. 
* The PCR(s) must include clinically relevant ECG tracings, 12-lead tracings and waveform capnography tracings when obtained.
* Additional data elements may be collected at the request of your Affiliate Hospital Medical Director. This data may pertain to, but is not limited to, trauma, cardiac arrest, stroke and infectious disease processes. 


MEDICATION USE AND STORAGE
* Medications may be administered in divided doses up to the maximum noted in protocol. Note that certain medications have a weight based dose maximum; divided doses up to the patient maximum are permitted.   
* Securely maintain and store all medications and fluids at the appropriate temperatures as designated by manufacturer's recommendations and in accordance with all Drug Control Program regulations.
* Pharmaceutical shortages and supply chain issues have become more frequent.  Whenever a medication is temporarily not obtainable in typical dosage forms as called for in the Statewide Treatment Protocols, or in any form, substitute concentrations and substitute medications may be used, in accordance with Advisory 22-08-01. All such temporary substitutions must be approved by the service's affiliate hospital medical director and affiliate hospital's pharmacy director, with a date of expiration for the temporary substitution authorized and meeting all other requirements of this Advisory. 
* All EMT personnel and ambulance services must adhere to all advisories, memos and administrative requirements issued by the Department.  
* Avoid hyperoxygenation, oxygen administration should be titrated to patient condition, and administered with evidence of hypoxemia, dyspnea, or an SpO2 <90%, especially in the presence of a suspected CVA/TIA or ACS.
IV pumps are the preferred method of administering vasoactive medications.  Norepinephrine and Epinephrine must be administered via pump.  If an ambulance does not have an infusion pump, consult medical control for preferred alternatives such as a fluid bolus or Dopamine administration. Paramedics with the equipment and training may begin using pumps immediately. Dopamine may be used until the pump is available. Paramedics with the equipment and training may begin using pumps immediately. 
EXCEPTION PRINCIPLE OF THE PROTOCOLS
* The Statewide Treatment Protocols represent the best efforts of the EMS physicians to pre-hospital providers of the Commonwealth and reflect the current state of out-of-hospital emergency medical care, and as such should serve as the basis for such treatment. 
* On occasion, good medical practice and the needs of patient care may require deviations from these protocols, as no protocol can anticipate every clinical situation. In those circumstances, EMS personnel deviating from the protocols should only take such actions as allowed by their training and only in conjunction with their on-line medical control physician.  
* Any such deviations must be reviewed by the appropriate local medical director, but for regulatory purposes are considered to be appropriate actions, and therefore within the scope of the protocols, unless determined otherwise on Department review by the State EMS Medical Director.

ADVANCED AIRWAY CONFIRMATION
* Advanced EMT and Paramedic treatment protocols require that EMTs provide advanced airway management when clinically indicated.  Specific training and airway adjuncts are necessary and require training in accordance with scope of practice and service specific devices.  
* Endotracheal tube insertion and supraglottic airway devices such as the King LT are commonly used in patients that require advanced airway management.  Airway devices must be secured, with depth noted as appropriate.
* All Paramedics must be able to insert NGT/OGT for those unconscious post-intubation patients who need gastric decompression. 
* The standard of care requires specific methods of verification to be used, including capnography and at least two of the following: auscultation, visualization of the chords, the presence of condensation, and other clinical signs that the advanced airway is positioned correctly.  
* All patients with an advanced airway in place must have recordable waveform capnography documented.
* Documentation on the PCR must include at least three evidence-based methods of verification of tube placement (one being capnography) and must include at least three separate times in which verification was completed, including verification of tube placement at the time of arrival at the receiving department and staff. 
* For patients under 12 years old, the airway is in most cases best managed with the insertion of an appropriate-sized oropharyngeal airway (OPA) with BVM ventilation with PEEP at 5 cm H2O or a SGA. In some cases, intubation may be preferred when other airway management methods are insufficient. This is at the discretion of the treating paramedic.

TRANSPORT DECISION
* Transport to the closest appropriate health care facility as defined in EMS regulations.  In rare circumstances, delayed transport may occur when necessary, treatment cannot be performed during transport.  
* Request and use available advanced life support (ALS)-Paramedic resources in accordance with these protocols. Initiate transport as soon as possible, with or without ALS.
* EMS personnel shall make decisions about the destination hospital in accordance with the EMS System regulations and Department-approved point-of-entry (POE) plans.
* There is currently Department-approved condition-specific POE plans for trauma, stroke and STEMI, as well as a POE for a patient's other condition or need, not covered in the specific POE plans.
* Department-approved regional POE plans for trauma, stroke and STEMI identify specific hospitals to be used. The EMT must be aware of all these POE plans affecting his/her service when choosing the appropriate hospital destination.
* Regardless of POE criteria, a patient with an uncontrolled airway, in arrest, or otherwise critically unstable due to issues not amenable to EMS intervention, should be brought to the closest hospital.  Consider consulting on-line Medical Control.
* EMS personnel may call -line Medical Control if they have a question about POE.
* Notify the receiving facility as early as possible on a recorded phone line or radio.
* Use of lights and sirens should be justified by the need for immediate medical intervention that is beyond the capabilities of the ambulance crew using available supplies and equipment.
* Hospital diversion of EMS traffic is not permitted in Massachusetts.  Hospitals may only refuse an ambulance if they are completely closed to all patients, including walk-in patients. (See Department's "Code Black" Memorandum, issued October 16, 2020: https://www.mass.gov/lists/emergency-department-circular-letters). Under this "Code Black" Memorandum, hospitals are required to notify EMS in the event of certain services being unavailable, and EMS may take that unavailability into account when deciding on nearest appropriate health care facility. 
* "Unavailable Service Notification" is defined in the Memorandum as a communication by a hospital to ambulance services of a temporary change in the Emergency Department capabilities. An unavailable service notification should be communicated to ambulance services if and only if any of the following operational conditions exist: closure of the operating room, lack of CT scan services, and closure of interventional cardiac catheterization lab. 

CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT (CQI)
* The Department's Hospital Licensure regulations for medical control service (105 CMR 130.1501-1504) require that hospital physicians providing medical direction must be knowledgeable in the communication system and its usage and must know the Statewide Treatment Protocols for each level of EMT.  
* Medical directors for ambulance services must take an active role in reviewing clinical performance and competency of its EMTs at all levels in the delivery of patient care and in overseeing and conducting the ambulance service's CQI process.
* Ambulance services with their AHMD must develop and implement a comprehensive and dynamic quality assurance program in accordance with the ambulance service's affiliation agreement.
* An ambulance service that has affiliate hospital medical director (AHMD) approval to use certain optional diagnostic and treatment modalities must do so in accordance with Section 6: Medical Director Options and its program specific CQI requirements.  The AHMD is responsible for overseeing such programs and ensuring the ambulance service meets the CQI requirements and the Department's data reporting requirements. 



1.1 High Quality CPR - Adult
Only for arrests of Cardiac etiology.  For primary respiratory etiology, ventilate immediately as part of CPR.
* Perform 2 minutes cycles of uninterrupted chest compressions.
* Interrupt chest compressions only after each 2-minute cycle
* Follow current AHA/ILCOR recommendations for cardiac arrest management.
FR/EMT STANDING ORDERS
* 1.0 Routine Patient Care -with focus on HQCPR
* Immediate chest compressions at a rate of 100-120 per minute
* Use AED as soon as possible with minimal interruption of chest compressions.
* Continue 2-minute cycles of uninterrupted chest compressions followed by 
      AED analysis and shock for 4 cycles (8 minutes)
* Place an oral or nasal airway.
* Ventilation / oxygenation options during 4 cycles (8 minutes):
      o	BVM ventilation during recoil and without interrupting compressions, OR
      o	If part of a care bundle, apply high flow oxygen via NRB
* After 4 cycles (8 MINUTES):
 o	Continue 2-minute cycles of uninterrupted chest compressions
        o	If passive insufflation was used, switch to BVM ventilation.  
        o	If trained and authorized consider supraglottic airway placement.
    ADVANCED EMT STANDING ORDERS 
*	Consider placement of a supraglottic airway device
* Place IV/IO without interrupting chest compressions.
PARAMEDIC STANDING ORDERS
* If utilizing a BVM, monitor quantitative waveform capnography throughout resuscitation to assess CPR quality and to monitor for signs of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC)
* Provide manual defibrillation as indicated after each 2-minute cycle
* After 4 cycles (8 minutes):
O         Consider endotracheal intubation or use an alternative airway without interrupting chest    compressions
* If authorized and trained by AHMD, Paramedics may use mechanical ventilators in  
    rate control mode with the following settings: 
* Rate of 8-12 breaths per minute
* Tidal volume 300-500mL 
* Start at FiO2 1.0 (100%) then titrate to maintain SpO2  > 94% (90% for COPD   
       patients)
* Relief pressure 45-60 cm/H2O
Paramedics may utilize a mechanical ventilator following the initiation of respiratory component at least 8 minutes after start of resuscitation even if ROSC has occurred. 

PEARLS:
* It is expected, unless special circumstances are present, initial 8 minutes of resuscitation will be                    performed on scene.
* Early CPR and defibrillation are the most effective therapies for cardiac arrest care.
* Minimize interruptions in chest compression, as pauses rapidly return the blood pressure to zero            and stop perfusion to the heart and brain.
* Recognizing the goal of immediate uninterrupted chest compressions, consider delaying application of mechanical CPR devices until after the first four cycles (8 minutes).  If applied during the first 4 cycles, the goal is to limit interruptions.  Mechanical devices should only be used by services that are practiced and skilled at their application.
* Switch compressors at least every two minutes to minimize fatigue.
* Perform chest compressions while defibrillator is charging and resume compressions immediately after the shock is delivered.

SECTION 2:
MEDICAL
PROTOCOLS



Statewide Treatment Protocols 
Version 2024.1









2.1 Adrenal Insufficiency/Adrenal Crisis - Adult and Pediatric
EMT STANDING ORDERS-Adult & Pediatric
*  1.0 Routine Patient Care
* Identify and treat the underlying condition.
* Consider paramedic intercept.
ADVANCED EMT STANDING ORDERS -Adult & Pediatric
* Obtain vascular access, if appropriate. 
PARAMEDIC STANDING ORDERS-Adult & Pediatric
Stress Dose:
* Adult: History of adrenal insufficiency; administer hydrocortisone 100mg IV/IO/IM or methylprednisolone 125mg IV/IO/IM. 
* Pediatric: History of adrenal insufficiency; administer hydrocortisone 2mg/kg, to a maximum of 100mg IV/IM/IO or methylprednisolone 2mg/kg to a maximum dose of 125mg IV/IM/IO. 
MEDICAL CONTROL MAY ORDER
* Additional doses of above medications.
* In patients who continue demonstrating the following signs and symptoms, consult medical control for repeat stress dose orders:
o Nausea, vomiting, weakness, dizzy, abdominal pain, muscle pain, dehydration, hypotension, tachycardia, fever, mental status changes.
* Additional Considerations:
o Aggressive volume replacement therapy.
o Treat other conditions according to specific protocols.
o Normalize body temperature.
Clinical notes:
Adrenal insufficiency results when the body does not produce the essential life-sustaining hormones cortisol and aldosterone, which are vital to maintaining blood pressure, cardiac contractility, water, and salt balance.
Chronic adrenal insufficiency can be caused by a number of conditions:
* Congenital or acquired disorders of the adrenal gland.
* Congenital or acquired disorders of the pituitary gland.
* Regular use of steroids (COPD, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and transplant patients).
Acute adrenal insufficiency can result in refractory shock or death in patients on a maintenance dose of hydrocortisone (SoluCortef)/prednisone who experience illness or trauma and are not given a stress dose and, as necessary, supplemental doses of hydrocortisone.
Clinical notes:
A "stress dose" of hydrocortisone should be given to patients with known chronic adrenal insufficiency who have the following illnesses/injuries:

* Shock (any cause). 
* Fever >100.4°F and ill-appearing.
* Multi-system trauma. 
* Drowning.

1.	One EMT should manage the patient while the other handles scene control, but no
 	EMT or First Responder should be left alone with the patient.
2.	Avoid areas/patients with potential weapons (e.g., kitchen, workshop), and avoid
	areas with only a single exit; do not allow patient to block exit.
3.	Keep environment calm by reducing stimuli (may need to ask family/friends to
	leave room, ask patient to turn off music/TV). Transport in a non-emergent mode
	unless the patient's condition requires lights and sirens.
4. 	Respect the dignity and privacy of the patient.
5. 	Make eye contact when speaking to the patient.

	or others?").
14.	Encourage patient to cooperatively accept transport to the hospital for a
 	psychiatric evaluation and treatment.
15.	Consider asking friends/relatives on scene to encourage patient to accept
 	transport, if needed; but only if they are not a source of agitation.
16.	Ask law enforcement or Online Medical Control to complete a Massachusetts Department of Mental Health (MDMH) Section 12application for uncooperative patients who acknowledge intent to self-harm or
 	harm others, but do not delay transport in the absence of this document.

2.5 Behavioral Emergencies: Restraint - Adult & Pediatric
EMT/ADVANCED EMT/PARAMEDIC 
OVERVIEW
In accordance with M.G.L. c. 111C, §18, the following guidelines may be followed to restrain a patient only when the patient presents an immediate or serious threat of bodily harm to him/herself or others. 
Adults (or emancipated minors as defined in A/R 5-610 who are competent with the functional capacity to understand the nature and effects of their actions and/or decisions have the right to refuse treatment and/or transport. Do not restrain these individuals. 
Procedures: 
1.	Follow Protocol 2.4 Behavioral Emergencies.
2.	Use the least restrictive method that assures the safety of the patient and others.
3. 	Use only soft restraints (leather restraints only if made with soft padding inside).
4. 	Remind law enforcement that for ambulance transport, patients who are
 	handcuffed must have handcuffs in front (not behind) or to the stretcher and that 
	the key must be readily available for removal, if needed. 
5. 	Apply restraints in a way that allows for airway, breathing, and circulation 
	assessment.
6. 	Never restrain a patient in a prone position or use equipment that forms a 
	"sandwich" around the patient.
7. 	Have a minimum of four (4) trained personnel coordinate the restraint effort and consider  
         involving parents if the patient is a child.
8. 	Secure the patient so that major sets of muscle groups cannot be used together, 	restraining the lower extremities to the stretcher first around the ankles and 
	across the thighs with soft restraints and stretcher straps. 
9. 	Restrain the patient's torso and upper extremities with one arm up and one arm 
	down with soft restraints and stretcher straps. Do not impair circulation.
10. 	Consider cervical-spine immobilization to minimize violent head/body movements. 
11. 	Pad under patient's head to prevent self-harm.
12. 	Secure backboard or scoop stretcher (if used) to ambulance stretcher.
13. 	Transport OB patients in a semi-reclining or left lateral position.
14. 	Monitor/record vital signs every 5 minutes, ensuring patient's airway remains clear.
15. 	Consider placing a non-rebreather mask (use only at 15 lpm) or a face mask 
	(NOT a P100/N95) on the spitting patient's face. 
16. 	Unless necessary for patient treatment, do not remove restraints until care is 
	transferred at the receiving facility or condition has changes to necessitate removal. 
17. 	Notify receiving facility and tell them that patient is restrained. 
18. 	Document restraint use details in the patient care report, including:
	a. reason for restraint use
	b. time of application	
	c. type(s) of restraints used, in addition to cot straps
	d. patient position
	e. neurovascular evaluation of extremities
	f. issues encountered during transport
	g. other treatment rendered
	h. police and/or other agency assistance

* Altered mental status (decreased, irritable, confused)
* Capillary refill time < 1 second(flash) or > 3 seconds
* Mottled cool extremities.
* Decreased urine output.
NOTE: Consider early consultation with Medical Control for suspected pediatric septic shock patients.
EMT STANDING ORDERS 
*1.0 Routine Patient Care
*Notify the hospital of an incoming Sepsis Alert prior to arrival if applicable. 
*Monitor and maintain airway and breathing as these may change precipitously.
*Administer oxygen and continue regardless of oxygen saturation levels.
*Obtain blood glucose reading if available.
*Do not delay transport.
ADVANCED EMT STANDING ORDERS 
*IV/IO fluids should be titrated to attain normal capillary refill, peripheral pulses,
     and level of consciousness.
*Administer fluid boluses of 20 mL/kg of 0.9% NaCl by syringe push method:
   o	Reassess patient immediately after completion of bolus and repeat 2    
           times (max 60 mL/kg) if inadequate response to boluses.
NOTE: Reassessment of patient after boluses should include assessment of
improving clinical signs and signs of volume overload (rales, increased work 
of breathing, or increased oxygen requirements).
PARAMEDIC STANDING ORDER 
* If there is no response after 3 fluid boluses, contact Medical Control to consider:
     o Additional fluids     OR
*Epinephrine infusion: 0.1 mcg/kg/min IV/IO, by infusion pump only, mixed based on your formulary/pump library and titrate to maintain perfusion with a max dose of 1 mcg/kg/min. 
       



PEARLS:
* To stabilize blood pressure-titrate infusions to maintain perfusion.  
* Blood pressure can be assessed by using this formula: 70+(age in years times 2). 
* Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response due to infection.  Frequent causes of septic shock include urinary, respiratory, or gastrointestinal infections and complications from catheters and feeding tubes.  Patients who are immuno-compromised are also susceptible to sepsis.
* Septic shock has a high mortality rate and is one of the leading causes of pediatric deaths.
* Aggressive IV therapy and early antibiotic significantly reduce death.

2.19 Hyperkalemia - Adult

EMT STANDING ORDERS 
*1.0 Routine Patient Care

ADVANCED EMT STANDING ORDERS 
* Acquire 12 Lead ECG if available and transmit as directed by affiliate hospital.
* For serum lab value > 6 mEq/L, request Paramedic if available but do not delay transport. 

PARAMEDIC STANDING ORDER

* Maintain continuous cardiac monitoring.
* Assure patient vascular access.
* Administer:
o Calcium chloride 1 gram IV over at least 5 minutes 
o May repeat X1 after 5 minutes.
   o Nebulized Albuterol (up to a max dose of 20 mg).
* Contact Medical Control for possible additional doses of calcium.
MEDICAL CONTROL MAY ORDER
* Additional doses of above medications.
Examples of moderate (6.2 mEq/L) to very severe (> 8 mEq/L) hyperkalemia ECG pattern

PEARLS:
* Hyperkalemia can lead to sudden death from cardiac arrest without warning.
* Some clinical factors predisposing patients to hyperkalemia:
* Chronic renal failure
* Acute renal failure (may be secondary to dehydration, shock, nephrotoxins, obstruction etc.)
* Crush injury/Compartment syndrome/rhabdomyolysis 
* ECG Evidence of hyperkalemia  
* Moderate: Peaked T waves with widening of QRS (>120ms), increases in the PR interval and decrease in the P wave amplitude. 
* Severe: Very wide QRS complex (often >240 ms) and loss of P waves. ECG pattern may develop a rounded and undulating "sine wave" pattern, especially in the limb leads.
* Ventricular fibrillation or asystole may develop without ECG evidence of hyperkalemia.
* The electrophysiological effects of hyperkalemia are proportional to both the potassium level and its rate of increase.
For serum potassium lab value known to be > 6 mEq without ECG findings of hyperkalemia, maintain continuous cardiac monitoring and consider obtaining direct medical control oversight.



















2.20 Home Hemodialysis Emergency Disconnect

EMT/ADVANCED EMT/PARAMEDIC STANDING ORDERS 
Home Hemodialysis Emergency Disconnect 
OVERVIEW
Some patients are now doing UNATTENDED (i.e., solo) home hemodialysis.  In the event you respond to a scene where such a patient is unable to disconnect themselves from the machine, and no one else is available who knows how to do so, follow this procedure to disconnect the patient for transport.
*1.0 Routine Patient Care 
* If time and patient condition permit, ALS backup should be called for BLS crews.

*IF you are trained in using HD shunt clamps, and such clamps are available, it is        
    acceptable to remove the HD needles from the patient's shunt and apply clamps. If not,  
    this procedure should be followed, leaving the needles in situ as described above and  
    below.
*The dialysis machine will be left at the home.
*If you can, note (or photograph) any clinically relevant values on the machine's readouts  
   (such as liters removed).
*For a patient with an AV shunt, the result of this procedure is that the patient still has  
    the dialysis needles in their AV fistula, ATTACHED to CLAMPED tubing, which is  
    wrapped with gauze to keep the needles and tubing next to the patient's arm 
(unless HD shunt clamps are used).
Procedure:
1. Push the STOP button on the front of the machine and unplug the machine's power cord.
2. Identify and close the 4 clamps on the tubing. If clamps are not on the tubing, use Kelly  
    clamps or plastic clamps (which will usually be on or near the dialysis machine) to clamp off   
    the 2 tubes both above and below the Luer lock disconnects.
The disconnects are in the center of the pictures below.






3.  If you are trained to do so, and you have sterile caps or sterile syringes, or they are on or near the dialysis machine, then swab each disconnect end-connector with alcohol and attach
the cap or syringe.
4.  You will now have two needle-tubing pieces still inserted into the patient's fistula.  GENTLY tape the tubing to the patient's arm, then LOOSELY wrap gauze around the arm.  DO NOT apply a pressure dressing.

If you accidentally pull a needle out of the fistula you will have to apply firm manual pressure (again, NOT a pressure dressing) to that bleeding point for 20 minutes - so likely will need a backup crew to provide medical care!







	









SECTION 3:

CARDIAC
EMERGENCIES

Statewide Treatment Protocols 
Version 2024.1

3.1 Acute Coronary Syndrome- Adult
Clinical Note: 
Not all patients with complaints of chest pain should be treated with aspirin, nitrates and oxygen. Consider the likelihood of ACS based on the nature of the symptoms, the patient's age, cardiac risk factors, past medical history, etc.
EMT STANDING ORDERS
* 1.0 Routine Patient Care
* Aspirin 324-325 mg. Check allergy status. Check contraindications. 
* Nitroglycerin 1 tab/spray SL every 5 minutes to a maximum 3 doses
* Must be patient's own NTG
* Include doses self-administered PTA
* SBP must be >120mmHg
* If suspected MI, determine patient eligibility for fibrinolytic therapy (within this protocol).
ADVANCED EMT STANDING ORDERS
* IV must be established before administration of nitroglycerin. 
* Nitroglycerin 0.4mg SL every 3-5 minutes while symptoms persist and if systolic BP remains >120 mmHg.
* If patient has taken their own Nitroglycerin PTA, and you have determined that the pharmacologic potency of that nitroglycerin was normal (based upon standard side effects of the med, e.g., headache/tingling sensation) without pain relief, contact Medical Control for other treatment options.
PARAMEDIC STANDING ORDERS
NOTE: A second IV line may be indicated for high-risk patients.
* Medication interventions based on risk for ACS, clinical presentation and/or diagnostic EKG changes. 
* Fentanyl 1 mcg/kg slow IV/IO/IM weight based (kg) to a max of 150mcg (150kg) or
      Fentanyl 1 mcg/kg IN weight based (kg) to a max of 150mcg (150kg).
MEDICAL CONTROL MAY ORDER
* Additional doses of above medications.
RED FLAG - Caution 
* Avoid nitroglycerin in ALL patients who have used a phosphodiesterase inhibitor such as: sildenafil (Viagra, Revatio), vardenafil (Levitra, Staxyn), tadalafil (Cialis, Adcirca) within the last 48 HOURS. These medications are often used for erectile dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension. Also avoid use in patients receiving intravenous epoprostenol (Flolan) which is also used for pulmonary hypertension.
Administer nitrates with extreme caution, if at all, to patients with inferior-wall STEMI or suspected right ventricular (RV) involvement because these patients require adequate RV preload.
RED FLAG: CAUTION
If patient appears to be having a ST-elevation MI (STEMI), refer to the appropriate STEMI-Point of Entry (POE) plan, and transport accordingly.

RED FLAG: CAUTION
Avoid hyperoxygenation, oxygen administration should be titrated to patient condition, and administered with evidence of hypoxemia, dyspnea, or an SpO2 <94%, especially in the presence of a suspected CVA/TIA or ACS.
Clinical Note: 
Additional signs and symptoms of an ACS patient may be:
Sudden onset of diaphoresis (cool, clammy, wet skin often profuse), anxiety, restlessness, abnormal vital signs such as an irregular pulse rate, and nausea / vomiting. 
All ACS patients must be carefully monitored until a definitive diagnosis can be made at the hospital and shall have a 12-lead evaluation done by EMT-Paramedics.  All patients with ACS-like symptoms of a non-traumatic etiology should be considered to be of cardiac origin until proven otherwise. 
Clinical Note:
Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) represents a spectrum of diseases.  There are at least three conditions identified within the spectrum of ACS: Classic anginal chest pain; atypical chest pain; anginal equivalents; Patients experiencing a myocardial infarction, or an ischemic event of unknown etiology may, based on 12-lead interpretation fall into one of three categories, "injury (STEMI)" or "Ischemia" or "Non-Diagnostic."
Classical Anginal Chest PainAtypical Chest PainAnginal EquivalentsCentral Anterior PainEpigastric discomfortDyspneaChest Pressure, tightnessMusculoskeletalSyncopeCrushing PainOften Unilateral"Generally Weak"Pain radiating to arms, neck and backNausea/VomitingPalpitations



*Note:  This checklist is intended only as a tool for the pre-hospital identification of patients with significant contraindication(s) to the administration of fibrinolytics in the acute ST elevation M.I. (STEMI) setting. It is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all factors to be considered prior to administration of these agents. Significant contraindications may warrant the triage of these patients to facilities capable of percutaneous intervention (PCI).  This list can also be used to determine if a possible ischemic stroke victim, is a candidate for ischemic stroke reperfusion.

ADVANCED EMT STANDING ORDERS
* Minimize interruptions of chest compressions for IV/IO placement. 
PARAMEDIC STANDING ORDERS
* Document presenting cardiac rhythm in two separate leads, if possible.
* Defibrillation when available, with minimum interruption in chest compressions (use manufacturer's recommended energy consistent with ACLS guidelines); then HQCPR for 5 cycles/2 minutes; then rhythm check; Charge defibrillator while performing chest compressions to minimize hands-off-time.
* Epinephrine 1mg IV/IO (10ml of a 0.1mg/ml solution), repeat every 3 - 5 minutes. May substitute vasopressin 40 units IV/IO in place of first or second dose of epinephrine. 
* Continue HQCPR and defibrillate (each shock at the energy recommended by the manufacturer consistent with ACLS guidelines) per ECC guidelines if ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia is persistent.

* Amiodarone 150 mg. slow IV/IO if one dose already given or 300 mg slow IV/IO if not already given.
* Lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg IV/IO; subsequent dosage: 0.5 to 0.75 mg/kg IV/IO every 3 - 5 minutes to a total dose of 3 mg/kg IV/IO.



NOTE:
* Early HQCPR and early defibrillation are the most effective therapies for cardiac arrest care.
* Minimize interruptions in chest compression, as pauses rapidly return the blood pressure to zero and stop perfusion to the heart and brain.
* Switch compressors at least every two minutes to minimize fatigue.
* Perform "hands on defibrillation."  
o Compress when charging and resume compressions immediately after the shock is delivered. 
* Do not hyperventilate as it increases intrathoracic pressure and decreases blood return to the heart.  Ventilate at a rate of 8 - 10 breaths per minute, with enough volume to produce adequate chest rise.


3.5P Cardiac Arrest (PEDIATRIC): Ventricular Fibrillation/Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia
FIRST RESPONDER/EMT/ADVANCED EMT STANDING ORDERS
* 1.0 Routine Patient Care-with focus on high quality CPR.
* Apply AED and use as soon as possible (with minimum interruption of chest compressions).   If unable to ventilate child after repositioning of airway: assume upper airway obstruction and follow Pediatric Upper Airway Obstruction Protocol
* Use AED as otherwise noted in these protocols and other advisories.	Use pediatric AED pads in accordance with weight and age guidelines for your specific AED
* Consider treatable causes.
* If suspected opioid overdose, administer Naloxone per Protocol 2.14 Poisoning/Substance Abuse/Overdose.
PARAMEDIC STANDING ORDERS

* Second defibrillate at 4 J/kg and all subsequent defibrillation at 4 J/kg (per AHA do not exceed 10J/kg per shock) every 2 minutes.
* Amiodarone 5 mg/kg IV/IO
MEDICAL CONTROL MAY ORDER
* Additional doses of above medications.
* Sodium bicarbonate 1 mEq/kg IV/IO.
* All other treatment modalities based upon suspected cause of VF/PVT.

Red Flag: For patients under 12 years old, the airway is in most cases best managed with a BVM or SGA. In some cases, intubation may be preferred. This is at the discretion of the treating paramedic.
NOTE:
The need for early defibrillation is clear and should have the highest priority.  Since these patients will all be in cardiopulmonary arrest, use of adjunctive equipment should not divert attention or effort from Basic Cardiac Life Support (BCLS) resuscitative measures, early defibrillation and Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS).  Remember: rapid defibrillation and high-quality CPR is the major determinant of survival.
NOTE:
* Early CPR and early defibrillation are the most effective therapies for cardiac arrest care.
* Minimize interruptions in chest compression, as pauses rapidly return the blood pressure to zero and stop perfusion to the heart and brain.
* Switch compressors at least every two minutes to minimize fatigue.
* Perform "hands on defibrillation."  
o Compress when charging and resume compressions immediately after the shock is delivered. 
* Do not hyperventilate as it increases intrathoracic pressure and decreases blood return to the heart.  Ventilate at an appropriate rate, with enough volume to produce adequate chest rise.

Note:
The committee on Trauma of the American College of Surgeons (ACS) and the American Burn Association (ABA) have identified certain injuries as those which generally require referral to a burn center.
The following injuries generally require referral to a burn unit:
1.	Partial thickness burns greater than 10% total body surface area (TBSA) 
2.	Burns that involve the face, hands, feet, genitalia, perineum, or major joints
3.	Third-degree burns in any age group
4.	Electrical burns, including lightning injury
5.	Chemical burns
6.	Inhalation injury
7.	Burn injury in patients with preexisting medical disorders that could complicate
	management, prolong recovery, or affect mortality. Burns in any patient with concomitant 	trauma (such as fractures) in which the burn injury poses the greatest risk of morbidity or 	mortality. In such cases, if the trauma poses a greater immediate risk than the burns, it
 	may be necessary to stabilize the patient in a trauma center before being transferred to a 	burn unit. Physician judgment is necessary in such situations and should be in concert
 	with established triage protocols.

EMT STANDING ORDERS 
* Routine Patient Care 
* Treat per Protocol 5.3 Tracheostomy Tube Obstruction Management, if applicable.
ADVANCED EMT STANDING ORDERS
* Determine presence of upper airway obstruction (stridor):
* If the obstruction due to a foreign body is complete or partial with inadequate air exchange:  Follow ECC guidelines for foreign body obstruction. Maintain an open airway, remove secretions, vomitus and assist ventilation as needed. 
* If partial obstruction due to a foreign body is suspected and the child has adequate air exchange: transport to appropriate medical facility. Do not attempt to remove foreign body in the field.
* If suspected croup (barking cough, no drooling) or epiglottitis (stridor, drooling), maintain an open airway, place child in position of comfort and avoid upper airway stimulation. 
MEDICAL CONTROL MAY ORDER
*      Emergent removal of tracheostomy tube, if present, and evidence of obstruction resulting in
        inadequate air exchange, treat per Protocol 5.3 Tracheostomy Tube Obstruction Management 
     for more information.
PARAMEDIC STANDING ORDERS
* Provide advanced airway management if indicated for mechanical obstruction: perform direct laryngoscopy if foreign body is suspected. If foreign body is visible and readily accessible, attempt removal with Magill forceps. If unable to remove obstructing foreign body, continue BLS airway management by providing positive pressure ventilations. 
* If foreign body is removed, proceed with endotracheal intubation if necessary and perform capnography. 
* If unable to clear airway obstruction, unable to intubate as needed or unable to perform positive pressure ventilations, perform a needle cricothyrotomy, if permitted under 6.3 Needle Cricothyrotomy.
* Administer Nebulized racemic epinephrine 11.25 mg in 2.5ml normal saline, for suspected severe croup, with stridor at rest and respiratory distress.

Red Flag: For patients under 12 years old, the airway is in most cases best managed with a BVM or SGA. In some cases, intubation may be preferred. This is at the discretion of the treating paramedic.


5.2 Difficult Airway-- Adult

The Difficult Airway protocol is to be used only after conventional attempts at airway management have failed and the patient cannot be ventilated by ordinary means such as with the insertion of an oral or nasal pharyngeal airway and bag-valve mask (BVM) ventilation or by insertion of a supraglottic airway device (SGA.) The patient care report must include all attempts at airway management, including failed attempts in order to illustrate the need for the use of this protocol. 
In all cases adjustments to technique are to be made based on training and equipment (i.e., mask size/seal, positioning, suction, and use of adjuncts). It is necessary to correct all manageable causes of inadequate ventilation prior to utilizing this protocol. When confronted with an airway that is unstable and conventional intubation is determined to be unlikely (Mallampati IV), EMTs are to use alternative equipment such as supraglottic airway devices, in accordance with your certification and training.
An Unstable Airway situation can be defined as unable to clear a foreign body airway obstruction, OR airway grading** (Figure 1 & 2) suggests intubation unlikely, OR unsuccessful intubation after no more than a total of 3 attempts.

ADVANCED EMT STANDING ORDERS
* 1.0 Routine Patient Care 
* Initiate ambulance transport as soon as possible
* Follow AHA and ARC guidelines for management of the adult foreign body airway obstruction (FBAO.)
* If BVM failure is the result of a manageable cause, apply counter measures.
* If the patient can be ventilated, but the airway is unstable insert a SGA device.  
PARAMEDIC STANDING ORDERS 
	a. If the airway is unstable and the adult patient cannot be ventilated, and if properly trained and authorized, treat per Protocol 6.2 Needle Cricothyrotomy or Protocol 6.10 Surgical Cricothyrotomy.

6.2 Needle Cricothyrotomy

 (Approved for Paramedics Only)
If properly trained and authorized by the affiliate hospital medical director paramedics may use this  technique  for performing needle cricothyrotomy. Due to differences in medical devices used by individual systems, the procedure may vary slightly. Refer to your local and regional guidelines for the technique and equipment used in your system. Appropriate body substance isolation precautions are required whenever caring for the trauma patient.

Indications: 
	1. The patient is in imminent danger of death.
	2. No alternative airway device/maneuver has been successful.
	3. The patient cannot be oxygenated or ventilated by any other means

Examples of types of patients potentially meeting the above criteria include (but are not limited to):
	1. Patients suffering traumatic arrest
	2. Patients suffering multiple traumatic injuries
	3. Patients suffering an upper airway obstruction

Procedure:

1. Assemble and prepare oxygen tubing by cutting a hole toward one end of the tubing.  Connect the other end of the oxygen tubing to an oxygen source, capable of delivering 50 psi or greater at the nipple and assure free flow of oxygen through the tubing.

2. Place the patient in a supine position.
3. Assemble a #12 or 14-gauge, 8.5 cm, over-the-needle catheter to a 6- to 12-mL syringe.
4. Clean the neck with an aseptic technique, using antiseptic swabs.
5. Palpate the cricothyroid membrane, anteriorly, between the thyroid cartilage and cricoid cartilage.  Stabilize the trachea with the thumb and forefinger of one hand to prevent lateral movement of the trachea during the procedure.
6. Puncture the skin midline with the needle attached to a syringe, directly over the cricothyroid membrane (i.e., mid-sagittal).  
7. Direct the needle at a 45-degree angle caudally, while applying negative pressure to the syringe.
8. Carefully insert the needle through the lower half of the cricothyroid membrane, aspirating as the needle is advanced.
9. Aspiration of air signifies entry into the tracheal lumen.
10. Remove the syringe and withdraw the stylet while gently advancing the catheter downward into position, being careful not to perforate the posterior wall of the trachea,
11. Attach the oxygen tubing over the catheter needle hub (you may use a 3.0-4.0 ET tube connector), and secure the catheter to the patient's neck.
12. Intermittent ventilation can be achieved by occluding the open hole cut into the oxygen tubing with your thumb for one second and releasing it for four seconds.  After releasing your thumb from the hole in the tubing, passive exhalation occurs.  Note: Adequate PaO2, can be maintained for only 30 to 45 minutes.
13. Continue to observe lung inflations and auscultate the chest for adequate ventilation.

6.3 Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) Medical Specialist
INTRODUCTION 
The Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) Medical Specialist is a paramedic or higher medical provider capable of delivering immediate medical response and support to urban search and rescue operations and based on the FEMA National USAR Task Force medical team model.  The primary mission of the medical team is to maintain the health and well-being of ALL team members during technical rescue operations.  The secondary mission is to provide specialized medical care to injured victims.  Overall, the role of the medical team is to act as the medical conscience for the team and to always act as an advocate for the patient. 
 
Medical Specialists follow the explicit orders of their agency's Affiliate Hospital Medical Director (AHMD) or designee functioning under a comprehensive set of local policies and protocols based on nationally accepted standards.  Per regulations, any EMS provider functioning at the ALS level of care must have a qualified and designated AHMD.  These protocols are intended for use only by trained Medical Specialists specifically during USAR operations.  Medical Specialists are not directly responsible for any person(s) outside the immediate area of operations, whose care may safely be provided by the local EMS provider.   
 
One of the primary functions of the Medical Specialist is to support the tactical operations by ensuring the health and safety of critical public safety personnel as well as any victims requiring specialty care inside the perimeter of high-risk, large-scale, and extended operations that otherwise cannot be attended to by conventional EMS providers.  As such, the Medical Specialist may be asked to provide sick call care for predefined service members as directed by the AHMD to ensure they remain healthy and operationally capable any other person(s) or service members who present with an acute medical issue, should be considered patients under the definition of 105 CMR 170.020.  Such care will be provided in accordance with the Statewide Treatment Protocols (STP.)  This specific protocol shall be used only by Medical Specialists functioning with an AHMD. 
 
Once a victim is removed from the inner perimeter of operations, a transition of care will be made to the local ambulance service for continued patient care and transport.  An exception may be made when a Medical Specialist's training is needed to manage a specific illness/injury during transport.  In this instance, a Medical Specialist should accompany the transporting EMS crew and patient to the hospital and maintain any care/medications not covered by the STP.  If during transport, the Medical Specialist encounters a significant conflict between these protocols and those of the transporting EMS agency, they should attempt to contact the Medical Specialist's AHMD and request a dual consult with the AHMD for the transporting ambulance service.  If the Medical Specialist's AHMD cannot be reached, standard online medical consultation should be initiated. 
 
STANDING/VERBAL MEDICAL ORDERS 
 
Given the medical complexity of most victims of a USAR scenario, it is the expectation that all patient care activity during USAR operations have real-time medical direction established with a USAR team physician or AHMD as soon as feasibly possible.  Any other on-scene EMT providing care at a special operations incident shall function in accordance with OEMS and service-specific protocols. 
These protocols are designed to provide supplemental guidance for patient care in the search and rescue environment.  Unless otherwise specified, all medication doses have been presented in a weight-based format for use in both adult and pediatric patients.  These guidelines represent the best practices drawn from current nationally accepted standards of care and evidence-based practice.  Medicine is a constantly evolving practice and as such, guidelines cannot be developed for every possible clinical situation.  These guidelines are NOT meant to replace good clinical judgment.  Medical team members shall not act beyond their usual scope of practice (i.e., USAR or other service-specific protocols) unless trained or specifically approved to perform additional skills. 
 
TRAINING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE/IMPROVEMENT 
 
Given the low frequency, high risk nature of these cases, it is presumed that ALL cases requiring the use of these protocols will undergo QA/QI review by the USAR team physician or AHMD.  Any deviations from these protocols will be reviewed by the AHMD and reviewed with the agency's medical team members.  It is also the expectation that as part of competency maintenance and participation as a Medical Specialist, a comprehensive training program by the AHMD and sponsoring agency will occur at least annually to include a review of these protocols.

I Confined Space / Collapse Rescue Patient Medical Care  

1. Perform an assessment of the scene, if not already done during the medical threat assessment: 
        a. Determine scene hazards. 
b. Survey the work environment for adequate oxygen levels, hazardous CO or other gas levels and any other hazardous materials around, lockout/tagout all utilities.  Ideally, this should be done in conjunction with the incident HAZMAT team manager or Safety Officer. 
c. Assess weather and weather forecast. 
 
2. Develop a medical care plan and prepare the appropriate needed supplies/equipment prior to entry "in the hole."  Planning should be performed in conjunction with the Task Force Leader (TFL) or Incident Commander (IC) and other USAR discipline-specific team leaders (i.e. Search, Rescue, HAZMAT, etc.). 
 
3. Perform initial assessment on the total number of victims, locations and priority of care/extrication. 
 
4. PROTECT THE PATIENT from further injury as well as particulate inhalation - ear and eye protection, dust mask (particulate mask, N95 or P-100 mask, oxygen via NRB mask, etc.), helmet, heat/cold protection.  Drop patient packs to the victim(s) if unable to access immediately. 
 
5. Once access is gained to the victim, a Medical Specialist should perform an initial clinical assessment of general condition, vital signs and injuries.  Initiate routine patient care as outlined in the Statewide Treatment Protocols.  
 
6. Assess for any unrecognized hemorrhage and control all sources of severe bleeding.  Use an approved tourniquet for life-threatening external hemorrhage that is anatomically amenable to tourniquet application or for any traumatic amputation.  Apply the tourniquet over the clothing proximal to the bleeding site as high as possible, or if able to fully expose and evaluate the wound, apply directly to the skin 2-3 inches above the wound (DO NOT APPLY OVER THE JOINT).  If a tourniquet is not needed, use other techniques to control bleeding. 
 
7. The patient's AIRWAY and BREATHING status should be assessed.  If necessary, perform advanced airway management utilizing direct in-line cervical spine immobilization only as needed.  Consider use of the Selective Spine Assessment Program (SSAP) .  A supraglottic airway device may be used in place of endotracheal tube if intubation is not possible. 
 
8. Begin cardiac monitoring.  Record and interpret a baseline 12-lead EKG as soon as possible. 

9. Obtain intravenous (IV) access and begin infusion of Normal Saline (NS). 
 
a) For signs and symptoms of hypovolemic shock, administer a 20 mL/kg bolus of NS. 
b) In the absence of signs of hypovolemia, administer 2 mL/kg/hour infusion of NS. 
c) If unable to obtain IV access, establish an IO (if indicated) and begin NS infusion. 
 
10. Reassess the victim for any uncontrolled hemorrhage.  If any tourniquets were placed earlier, they should be reassessed for adequate hemorrhage control.  Consider the use of hemostatic gauze pressure dressing for exsanguinating wounds not amenable to tourniquet use. 
 
If a victim is anticipated to need significant blood transfusion (for example: presents with hemorrhagic shock, one or more major amputations, penetrating torso trauma, or evidence of severe bleeding) and is within 3 hours from time of injury, administer tranexamic acid (TXA) properly trained and authorized to do so, in accordance with Protocol 6.4 Tranexamic Acid. , 
11. Assess for and treat potential hypoglycemia and dehydration.  Consider oral hydration so long as the patient can follow commands, is alert and oriented, and a patent airway and gag reflex is present.  This should be done only if prolonged extrication is anticipated and there are no other means of fluid administration.  Limit initial hydration to 16-32 ounces of potable water.  
 
12. Assess and manage the victim for any evidence of entrapment or crush injury.  Refer to the USAR Crush Injury/Crush Syndrome management protocol. 
 
13. Monitor patients for hypothermia or hyperthermia.  Preferably, a core temperature measurement should be obtained.  Treat per Protocols 2.7 Hyperthermia (Environmental) and 2.8 Hypothermia (Environmental.)  
 
14. If available and trained to do so, draw blood sample and analyze blood chemistry using point-of-care testing.  Continue analyzing PRN and consult with an AHMD for further direction. 
 
15. For pain management of the non-isolated extremity injury refer to the USAR Sedation and Analgesia protocol.
 
16. Reassess the medical care plan with the AHMD and rescue team leader as appropriate. 


Crush Injury / Crush Syndrome Management 
1. Consider the use of an approved tourniquet to prevent reperfusion of a crushed limb prior to removal of compressive forces only if pre-treatment of the patient cannot be performed. 
 
2. Initiation of fluid resuscitation with NS should ideally occur prior to any extrication or release from compressive forces.  Administer fluids at an initial rate of 1 L/hr (10-15 ml/kg/hr) for up to 2 L total.  Subsequent fluid administration can be delivered at a rate up to 500 ml/hr (5-7 ml/kg/hr) up to 24 hours. 
 
a. CAUTION: Given the risk of hyperkalemia due to crush injury, potassium containing solutions (i.e., Lactated Ringers solution) should be avoided. 
 
3. For victims with prolonged crush (> 1-2 hour) or at high risk of crush syndrome, initiate serum alkalinization prior to extrication.  Bicarbonate therapy should be goal directed based on available clinical data (i.e. urine output, hemodynamic parameters, evidence of hypocalcemia, etc.) and point-of-care testing (urine and serum pH, serum electrolyte levels, etc.).  Consider alternating bicarbonate-containing fluids with NS to minimize volume overload.  Medical Direction should be consulted for any use of bicarbonate therapy. 

a. Add 150 mEq of 8.4% (1 mEq/ml) sodium bicarbonate into a 1 L D5W bag infused at a rate of 250-500 ml/hr.  Remember to remove 150 ml of D5W to accommodate the sodium bicarbonate.  This mixture provides a near "isotonic" solution capable of alkalinizing the bloodstream.  
b. If 1 L D5W bags are not available, add 50 mEq of sodium bicarbonate to 1 L NS bag infused at a rate of 500 ml/hr.
c. Bolus doses of sodium bicarbonate at 0.5 - 2 mEq/kg IV/IO in accordance with STP can be administered if an infusion cannot be initiated.
d. For pediatric patients, administer bicarbonate infusion at the following rates: 
Up to 10 kg: 8 ml/kg/hr 
	10-20 kg:  80 ml/hr + 4 ml/kg/hr 
	   >20 kg:  160 ml/hr + 2 ml/kg/hr
e. Consider placement of a urine bladder catheter to monitor urine output to a diuresis goal of > 200-300 ml/hr (3-4 ml/kg/hr) or a urine pH of > 6.5. 
 
4. Reassess the patient and coordinate extrication with technical rescue personnel.  Be vigilant for sudden hypotension and hyperkalemic changes.  Be prepared to control severe hemorrhage as well as the development of compartment syndrome if fluid begins to third space into injured tissue. 
 
5. For patients with point of care values or EKG findings consistent with hyperkalemia refer to the hyperkalemia protocol.

Hyperkalemia

1. Administer 1 gram of calcium chloride 10% (100 mg/ml) IV/IO bolus (20 mg/kg IV/IO for pediatric patient) over 2 minutes. Calcium chloride should not be routinely given to crush patients unless there is evidence of hyperkalemia (ECG changes, i-STAT confirmed).  NOTE: DO NOT ADMINISTER CaCl and NaHCO3 in the same IV line as a salt may precipitate.
 
2. Administer sodium bicarbonate 0.5 - 2 mEq/kg IV bolus.  However, if the patient is already receiving large volumes of sodium bicarbonate as an infusion, contact medical direction for further guidance.
 
3. Administer albuterol sulfate 0.083% up to 10 mg via inline nebulizer. 
 
4. Administer 10 Units of regular insulin IV/IO followed by 50 ml of Dextrose 50% (25 gm/50 ml) IV OR Dextrose 10% IV/IO [25gm/250ml] for adult hyperkalemic patients with medical direction.  For pediatric patients, administer 0.1 Units/kg of regular insulin (up to 10 units) IV/IO bolus followed by D10W 0.5 g/kg (5 mL/kg) IV bolus (infants) or D25W 0.5 -1 g/kg (2 - 4 mL/kg) IV/IO bolus (child).  Blood glucose monitoring should be repeated in 30 minutes and treated appropriately. 
 
5. Contact medical direction for furosemide 0.5-1 mg/kg IV/IO bolus.
Limb Injury / Compartment Syndrome 
1. Control any life-threatening hemorrhage with direct pressure, hemostatic dressing or tourniquet placement, assess distal CSM function and splint any obvious deformities. 
 
2. Consider placing an approved tourniquet (do not tighten) as distal as possible near site of injury if there is potential for severe hemorrhage upon release of an entrapped limb. 
 
3. Depending on the degree of tissue injury, bony involvement, duration of patient rescue and overall environmental conditions, tetanus and antibiotics administration may be indicated.  Consult medical control for further direction on specific antibiotic type and dosing. 
 
4. Monitor closely for the development of compartment syndrome, especially in fixed muscle compartments such as the forearm or lower leg. Compartment syndrome is typically the result of muscle tissue swelling within the non-expansive fascial compartments which pressure rises greater than tissue perfusion pressure. 
 
5. Palpate limbs carefully (especially where entrapped or laid upon) for firmness or functional loss.  Some signs/symptoms to watch for include: 
 
a. PAIN out of proportion to physical examination. 
b. PALLOR of skin color 
c. PARESTHESIAS 
d. PARALYSIS 
e. PULSELESSNESS (This is often a late sign.  The presence of a distal pulse DOES NOT rule out compartment syndrome) 
 
6. Ensure adequate fluid resuscitation of the patient. 
7. If compartment syndrome is recognized, immediately consult with a medical control regarding further treatment.  Fasciotomy should NOT be routinely performed in the field due to technical difficulties, inadequate analgesia and high rates of wound infection.  Contact medical direction for further guidance. 
Amputation
1. Amputation of a limb should ONLY be considered if there is an immediate threat to life as a LAST RESORT for freeing an entrapped victim, trading limb for life.  An extreme circumstance is when it has been assessed that an entrapped limb is the ONLY remaining impediment to extricating an entrapped victim. 
 
2. The decision to performing a field amputation should be made by a USAR team physician or AHMD (preferably on-scene) in coordination with a trauma surgeon whenever possible and in conjunction with the TFL or IC.  The procedure should be ONLY performed by an appropriately trained physician. 
 
3. Properly prepare the patient as much as time allows for amputation and immediate extrication - supplemental oxygen, end-tidal CO2 and cardiac monitoring, adequate IV access, VS monitoring.  Ensure all necessary equipment is nearby. 
 
4. Expose the entrapped extremity as distally as possible. 
 
5. Place an approved tourniquet as distally as possibly, leaving just enough soft tissue to perform the amputation and should only be tightened prior to amputation under direction of medical control. 
 
6. Administer the appropriate analgesia and sedation. 
 
7. After the procedure has been completed, assess the limb for any re-bleeding (tourniquet tightening, additional tourniquet placement, bone marrow bleeding, etc.), dress the wound appropriately and consider the early administration of prophylactic antibiotics as directed by medical control. 
 


Sedation and Analgesia
Adequate pain control is an integral component in effecting a successful victim rescue.  
Pharmacological agents available to the medical specialist should both be easy to titrate and have minimal impact on cardiorespiratory function. 
1. Perform Confined Space/Collapse Rescue Patient Medical Care. 
 
2. Ensure that all appropriate monitoring (ECG monitoring, NIBP, pulse oximetry, ETCO2, etc.) have been placed on the patient as feasibly possible given the operational environment.

3. Moderate to severe pain can be managed in accordance with Protocol2.13 Pain and Nausea Management.

4. For patients in pain that cannot be adequately controlled with the above agents, ketamine hydrochloride at a sub-dissociative dose repeated every 20-30 minutes until pain is controlled or the development of nystagmus:
	a.  Adult: 10-20 mg IV/IO bolus or 50 mg IM
	b.  Pediatric: 0.1-0.2 mg/kg IV/IO bolus or 0.4 mg/kg IM
5. In the event an emergent field procedure is to be performed (i.e. limb amputation, fracture/dislocation reduction, soft tissue injury repair, etc.), procedural sedation may be appropriate in order to achieve adequate operating conditions for the patient.  A USAR team physician or AHMD MUST BE contacted prior to any sedation for procedures or extrication.

6.18 Buprenorphine for OPIOID WITHDRAWL - ADULT

EMT/ADVANCED EMT/EMT PARAMEDIC STANDING ORDERS

Purpose:
Buprenorphine has unique pharmacological properties that help diminish the effects of physical dependency to opioids such as withdrawal symptoms and cravings.  Its use offers important treatment option for opioid use disorder and provides people with a greater opportunity to sustain long term recovery. 
 
This may be especially useful in EMS care because often a patient has just received naloxone as a rescue medication and is therefore in withdrawal. With EMS offering buprenorphine for immediate symptom relief, the patient will often become more willing to allow EMS to enter them into the medical care system, where they may continue the medication, and perhaps be able to reduce their opioid need. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) patients receiving medication such as buprenorphine even in lower doses cut their risk of death in half.


1.0 Routine Patient Care, then

1. Assess Opioid Withdrawal Signs & Symptoms
   Objective Signs 
* Tachycardia, diaphoresis, restlessness and/or agitation, dilated pupils, rhinorrhea or lacrimation, vomiting, diarrhea, yawning, piloerection.
   Subjective Signs
* Nausea, stomach/abdominal cramps, body aches, achy bones/joints, restlessness, hot and cold, nasal congestion.

2. Assess for exclusion criteria.
* Under 18 years of age
* Pregnant
* Altered mental status and unable to give consent.
* Severe medical illnesses (sepsis, respiratory distress, etc.)
* No clinical opioid use disorder symptoms
* Unable to comprehend potential risks and benefits for any reason.
* Not a candidate for buprenorphine treatment for any reason.
IF NO EXCLUSION CRITERIA
Evaluate according to the Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (COWS) 
* If greater than or equal to 5 assess patient interest in treatment with buprenorphine. (If less than 5, the patient is NOT eligible for buprenorphine.)
* If the patient refuses treatment, treat other conditions, and transport to the hospital.  
* 

IF PATIENT AGREES TO TREATMENT
Standing Orders
* Give water to moisten mucous membranes.
* Administer 16mg sublingual buprenorphine. 
* Transport to the hospital and reassess COWS in 10 minutes.
* If withdrawal symptoms worsen or persist, redoes with 8mg buprenorphine. 
CAUTION:
1. If at any point the patient refuses transport, go through refusal process per Protocol 7.5 Refusal of Medical Care and Ambulance Transport 
2. Provide leave-behind naloxone

Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS)
Below is the flowsheet for measuring symptoms for opiate withdrawals over a period of time.
For each item, write in the number that best describes the patient's signs or symptom. Rate on
just the apparent relationship to opiate withdrawal. For example, if heart rate is increased
because the patient was jogging just prior to assessment, the increase pulse rate would not add to the score.
Note, this checklist is required to determine COWS score when assessing patient eligibility and post-treatment.

Statewide Treatment Protocols 
Version 2024.1

7.1 Air Medical Transport
Introduction: 
The use of air medical services has become the standard of care for many critically ill or injured patients who require transport to specialized medical facilities in accordance with Department-approved Statewide Point-of-Entry (POE) plans, such as Trauma, Stroke and STEMI (PCI) centers. 
This protocol has been established so that air medical support does not require Medical Control approval.  However, contacting Medical Control should be considered whenever appropriate and when the protocol requires it.  The following constitutes the philosophical foundation for calling for air medical transport.   
o Patients in cardiac arrest subsequent to blunt trauma in general should not be transported by air ambulance.  In the event of cardiac arrest after the request for air ambulance the air medical crew may be utilized for resuscitation and transport either by ground or air.   
o Patients with an uncontrolled or compromised airway should be brought to the nearest appropriate facility unless advanced life support (ALS) service (by ground or air) can intercept in a more timely fashion. 
o Patients in cardiac arrest subsequent to penetrating truncal or extremity trauma MAY be appropriate for transport by air ambulance IF the ETA for the responding aircraft is less than ground transport time to closest facility.  
o EMS personnel should consider requesting ground advanced life support (ALS) and air medical support when both the operational and patient conditions listed below exist.  

Operational Conditions: 
In general, the patient should begin movement toward the appropriate receiving facility as soon as practical.  Consider landing zones located along the route of travel to minimize total field time.  

Air Medical Transport should be considered when;
1. Ground transport time to the closest appropriate point of entry hospital exceeds the arrival time of air medical, OR 
2. Patient location, weather or road conditions preclude the use of standard ground ambulance, OR
3. Prolonged scene patient management due to entrapment/extrication challenges, OR
4. Multiple patients are present that will exceed the capabilities of local hospitals and agencies.   

Patient Conditions 
	1. Physiologic Criteria: 
       	a. Unstable Vital Signs 
	2. Anatomic Injury: 
	a. Evidence of Spinal Cord injury including paralysis or paresthesia. 
	b. Severe Blunt Trauma: 
* Head injury (Glasgow Coma Scale of twelve [12] or less) 
* Severe chest or abdominal injury
* Severe pelvic injury excluding simple hip fractures. 
c. Two or more proximal long-bone fractures
d. Burns: 
* Greater than 20% Body Surface Area (BSA) second or third degree burns;
* Evidence of airway or facial burns; 
* Circumferential extremity burns; or 
* Burns associated with trauma. 
		e. Penetrating injuries of head, neck, chest, abdomen or groin. 
		 f.  Amputation of extremities, excluding digits. 
3.Cardiac Conditions 
a) ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)
b) Persistent unstable Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) 
4. Stroke
a) Concern for Large Vessel Occlusion (LVO) by FAST-ED within 24- hours of last known well time
b) Pediatric patients
c) Pregnancy

Special Conditions: The following should be considered in deciding whether to request 
air medical transport, for traumatically injured patients, but are not automatic or absolute criteria: 
	1. Mechanism of Injury 
     a) Motor Vehicle Crash
     b) Patient ejected from vehicle.
     c) Death in the same vehicle such as the passenger compartment
     d) Patient struck by a vehicle and thrown (ejected) more than 15-feet or run over by a
    vehicle. 
	2. Significant Medical History 
a) Age less than 8 or greater than 55 years of age. 
b) Significant coexistent illness (such as anticoagulation). 
c) Pregnancy. 


7.2 Electronic Control Weapons
Purpose: In some situations, state and local law enforcement utilize devices known as electronic control weapons (ECW), such as a TASER(r), to assist with controlling persons.  When used, the device discharges a wire that, at the distal end, contains an arrow-like barbed projectile that penetrates the suspect's skin and embeds itself, allowing the officer to administer an incapacitating electric shock. Current medical literature does not support routine medical evaluation for an individual after an ECW application.  In most circumstances, probes can be removed by law enforcement without further medical intervention. 
EMS should be activated following ECW application in the following circumstances:
* The probe is embedded in the eye, genitals, or bone.
* Seizure is witnessed after ECW application.
* There is excessive bleeding from the probe site after probe removal.
* Cardiac arrest, complaints of chest pain, palpitations.
* Respiratory distress.
* Change in mental status after application.
* Pregnancy.

Removal must be done by law enforcement unless lodged in a vulnerable area.

CONTRAINDICATIONS TO REMOVAL
* Patients with probe penetration in vulnerable areas of the body as mentioned below should be transported for further evaluation and probe removal.
* Genitalia, female breast, or skin above level of clavicles.
*      Suspicion that probe might be embedded in bone, blood vessel, or other sensitive structure.

EMT/ADVANCED EMT/PARAMEDIC STANDING ORDERS
	1. 1.0 Routine Patient Care.
	2. Ensure wires are disconnected from weapon.
	3. Secure probe with padded dressing.
	4. Transport to Emergency Department.

NOTE: When EMS is called for ECW application, barring patient refusal, the patient will be transported to the hospital

7.3 Medical Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment (MOLST) and Comfort Care/ Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) Order Verification
Introduction
EMS personnel at all levels are required to provide emergency care and transport patients to appropriate health care facilities. EMS personnel are further required to provide treatment to the fullest extent possible, subject to their level of certification and the level of licensure of the ambulance service for which they are working. However, more and more patients, where it is medically appropriate, are opting for limitations on life-sustaining treatments, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), in the event of cardiac arrest. Thus, EMS personnel may encounter a patient who has chosen such options and has either a Massachusetts Medical Orders for Life Sustaining Treatments (MOLST) or the Comfort Care/DNR Order Verification Form or bracelet (CC/DNR). These documents provide for a statewide, standardized form, approved by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (Department), Office of Emergency Medical Services (OEMS), that EMS personnel can instantly recognize as an actionable order (MOLST) or verification of such an order (CC/DNR) regarding the use of life sustaining treatments. This protocol governs EMS personnel response to a patient with a MOLST or CC/DNR form.
Implementation Procedures
1. Confirm the identity of the individual with the MOLST or CC/DNR Order Verification Form or bracelet.
2. Check validity: 
a. CC/DNR: To assure that a DNR order is recognized in any out-of-hospital setting, an attending physician, nurse practitioner, or authorized physician assistant, who is licensed in Massachusetts, must provide a patient who has a current DNR order, with a fully executed CC/DNR Order Verification form to verify the existence of a DNR order. To be valid, the CC/DNR Order Verification Form shall contain:
i. the patient's name, and all other patient identifiers requested on the form; 
ii. date of issuance;
iii. the signature and telephone number of an attending physician, nurse practitioner, or authorized physician assistant; 
iv. the signature and printed name of the patient, guardian or health care agent signing the form, with the following exception; and,
v. a date of expiration, if any, of the underlying DNR order. If there is a date of expiration, and that date has passed, the CC/DNR is not valid.
b. MOLST: Alternatively, to assure a patient with a desire to document decisions regarding DNR and/or other life-sustaining treatments (which includes CPR, intubation with ventilation, and non-invasive ventilation, such as bilevel and continuous positive airway pressure, or BiPAP/CPAP) has those preferences honored, a Massachusetts-licensed attending physician, nurse practitioner or authorized physician assistant can provide a patient with a MOLST form. The MOLST form represents actual medical orders to EMS personnel related to a patient's preferences for resuscitation, ventilation, and hospitalization. To be valid, the MOLST form must contain:
i. patient name and appropriate identifiers as requested on the form;
ii. box D and E of the MOLST form must be fully completed for page 1 to be considered valid - which is all that is relevant for EMS personnel. The form must be signed by a patient, patient's guardian, or activated health care agent. For a patient in a licensed health care facility only, this requirement is met if the guardian or agent cannot sign the form, and the licensed health care facility provides an alternate signature indicating that the required conversation with the guardian or agent has occurred and the form reflects the patient's wishes and goals of care as expressed to the clinician who signed Section E on the agent's behalf. If a MOLST form is presented by the licensed health care facility with such signatures in box D, EMS can assume the form is valid;
iii. A MOLST order that has an expiration date or revocation date that is in the past is not valid.
c. Revocation: A MOLST order for DNR or CC/DNR form may state it has been revoked. If that is the case, the order or form is not valid.
d. Health Care Agent with Documentation on Scene: If the patient's activated health care agent is on scene with his/her health care proxy document in hand, the health care agent may change or revoke the patient's MOLST form directions. EMS is not responsible for checking the validity of the health care proxy document. If presented by a health care agent, they can assume it is valid. 
3. Action of EMS if no valid CC/DNR or no valid MOLST that includes a DNR order: In accordance with standard EMS Statewide Treatment Protocols, EMS personnel will resuscitate patients without a valid CC/DNR Order Verification Form or without a MOLST that has documented a DNR order, as well as a patient who has a MOLST form indicating a preference FOR resuscitation. Remember, if there is any doubt about the current validity of a MOLST or CC/DNR Order Verification form, EMS personnel are to resuscitate and provide care in accordance with the Statewide Treatment Protocols.
4. Patient Care for confirmed valid CC/DNR or MOLST with orders for DNR:
a. If the patient is in full respiratory or cardiac arrest, the EMS personnel shall not resuscitate, which means: 
i. do not initiate CPR, 
ii. do not insert an oropharyngeal airway (OPA), 
iii. do not provide ventilatory assistance, 
iv. do not artificially ventilate the patient (e.g., mouth-to-mouth, bag valve mask), 
v. do not administer chest compressions, 
vi. do not initiate advanced airway measures,
vii. do not administer cardiac resuscitation drugs, and 
viii. do not defibrillate. 
b. If the patient is not in full respiratory or cardiac arrest, but the patient's heartbeat or breathing is inadequate, EMS personnel shall not resuscitate but shall provide, within the scope of their training and level of certification, full palliative care and transport, as appropriate, including: 
i. additional interventions a patient has indicated be given on the MOLST form, including intubation with ventilation or non-invasive ventilation such as BiPAP/CPAP. 
ii. emotional support; 
iii. suction airway; 
iv. administer oxygen; 
v. application of cardiac monitor; 
vi. control bleeding; 
vii. splint; 
viii. position for comfort; 
ix. initiate IV line; and, 
x. contact Medical Control, if appropriate for further orders, including necessary medications. 
c. If the patient is not in respiratory or cardiac arrest, and the patient's heartbeat and breathing are adequate, but there is some other emergency illness or injury, the EMS personnel shall provide full treatment and transport, as appropriate, within the scope of their training and level of certification. 
5. Questions about the MOLST or CC/DNR:  If EMS personnel have any questions regarding the applicability of the MOLST or CC/DNR form with regard to any specific individual, or a good-faith basis to doubt the continued validity of the MOLST or CC/DNR form, EMS personnel shall verify with the patient if the patient is able to respond. If the patient cannot respond, EMS personnel shall provide full treatment and transport, or contact Medical Control for further orders. In all cases, EMS personnel shall document the circumstances on the trip record.
6. Previously initiated CPR: In the event of respiratory or cardiac arrest and resuscitative efforts are initiated prior to EMS confirmation of the valid DNR order on the MOLST form or a valid CC/DNR Order Verification form, EMS shall discontinue the following measures: a) CPR; b) cardiac medications, and c) advanced airway measures. 
7. Documentation: EMS personnel must document the existence and validity of the MOLST order or CC/DNR form on their patient care report (PCR). For a MOLST form, EMS personnel must specifically document on the PCR all clinical information on the MOLST form regarding the patient's preferences for care. For both MOLST and CC/DNR Order Verification Form, EMS personnel must also document on the PCR all care they provided to the patient, including palliative measures. 	
8. Revocation on scene: The MOLST order with DNR or CC/DNR may be revoked by the patient at any time, regardless of mental or physical condition, by the destruction or affirmative revocation of the MOLST or CC/DNR Order Verification, or by the patient's direction that the MOLST or CC/DNR Order Verification not be followed by EMS personnel or be destroyed. It may also be revoked by the patient's activated health care agent who is on scene with his/her health care proxy document in hand. EMS personnel, upon witnessing or verifying a revocation, shall communicate that revocation in writing to the hospital to ensure its inclusion in the patient's medical record. EMS personnel shall also document the revocation on their PCR. 


7.4 Pediatric Transport 

PATIENT TRANSPORT
Massachusetts statute requires that all children under the age of 8 traveling in a motor vehicle must be secured in a child passenger restraint (i.e., car seat), unless they are 57 inches or taller, in which case, they need to be using a seat belt. An ill or injured child must be restrained in a manner that minimizes injury in an ambulance crash. The best location for transporting a pediatric patient is on the ambulance cot. The method of restraint will be determined by various circumstances including the child's medical condition and weight.  
ANY EXCEPTIONS TO THIS PROTOCOL REQUIRE REAL-TIME MEDICAL CONTROL ORDERS.  Note that exceptions to this protocol will likely result in substantially increased injury risk to the transported child, and medical control input will be needed to balance the risks against the risks of delay in transport.
A patient who is a child must be transported with 5-point harness in a device designed for such a purpose.
Attach device securely to cot utilizing upper back strap behind cot and lower straps around cot's
frame, or as per manufacturer's instructions.
•	5-point harness must rest snugly against child.
•	Adjust head portion of cot according to manufacturer's recommendation.
Infants under 5 kilograms who also require temperature regulation should be transported in a transport isolette that has been designed for EMS use.
NON-PATIENT TRANSPORT
Important Note: Best practice is to transport well children in a vehicle other than the ambulance, whenever possible, for safety.  Examples of acceptable transport in another vehicle would be by police cruiser without a cage and only in the back seat, a family members personal car, or another response vehicle, only in the back seat If no other vehicle is available and circumstances dictate that the ambulance must transport a well child, he/she may be transported in the following ways;
* Children who require a car seat or booster seat should be secured to the airway seat/captain's chair in patient compartment using a size appropriate integrated seat or a convertible safety seat that is secured safely in relationship to the orientation of the captain's chair.
* All infants and toddlers should ride in a rear-facing seat until the highest weight or height allowed by their car seat manufacturer.  Every effort should be made to properly secure the car seat according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
* Passenger seat of the driver's compartment if child is large enough (according to the
manufacturer's recommendations) to ride forward-facing in a child safety seat or booster seat. Airbag should be turned off. If the air bag can be deactivated, an infant, restrained in a rear-facing infant seat, may be placed in the passenger seat of the driver's compartment.




MOTHER AND NEWLY BORN TRANSPORT
Transport the newly born in an approved size-appropriate child restraint system that complies with the injury criteria of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 213 in the rear-facing EMT seat /captain's chair that prevents both lateral and forward movement, leaving the cot for the mother. Use a convertible seat with a forward-facing belt path). DO NOT use a rear-facing-only seat in the rear-facing EMT's seat. You may also use an integrated child restraint system certified by the manufacturer to meet the injury criteria of FMVSS No. 213.
USE OF PATIENT'S CHILD PASSENGER SAFETY SEAT AFTER INVOLVEMENT IN MOTOR VEHICLE CRASH
The patient's safety seat may be used to transport the child to the hospital after involvement in a minor crash if ALL of the following apply:
* It is a convertible seat with both front and rear belt paths.
* Visual inspection, including under movable seat padding, does not reveal cracks or
deformation.
* Vehicle in which safety seat was installed was capable of being driven from the scene of the crash.
* Vehicle door nearest the child safety seat was undamaged.
* Air bags (if any) did not deploy.


7.5 Refusal of Medical Care and Ambulance Transport

PURPOSE: 
Establish guidelines for the management and documentation of situations where patients refuse treatment or transportation.
Under the Commonwealth's EMS System regulations, at 105 CMR170.355 (A) "Responsibility to Dispatch, Treat and Transport," ambulance services and their agents may not refuse any of these responsibilities, absent a documented patient refusal. Ambulance services and their EMS personnel must be extremely cautious about accepting patient refusals. 

Refusal of care
There are three components to a valid refusal of care. Absence of any of these components will most likely result in an invalid refusal. The three components are as follows: 

1. Competence: In general, a patient who is an adult or a legally emancipated minor * is considered legally competent to refuse care. A parent or legal guardian who is on-scene may refuse care on his or her minor children's behalf. 

2. Capacity: In order to refuse medical assistance a patient must have the capacity to understand the nature of his or her medical condition, the risks and benefits associated with the proposed treatment, and the risks associated with refusal of care. An activated health care agent who is named in a health care proxy document for the patient may refuse care on behalf of the patient only if 1) he or she is on-scene and 2) he or she has his/her health care proxy document in hand to show EMS. If the patient objects to the health care agent's decision, there is no effective refusal. If there is any doubt about the health care agent's authority, EMS is to transport the patient.

3. Informed Refusal: A patient must be fully informed about his or her medical condition, the risks and benefits associated with the proposed treatment and the risks associated with refusing care. 
Patients who meet criteria in this Protocol shall be allowed to make decisions regarding their medical care, including refusal of evaluation, treatment, or transport. These criteria include: 

1. Initiated solely by the patient, not suggested/prompted by the EMTs.
2. Adults (≥ 18 years of age) and legally emancipated minors*
3. Orientation to person, place, time, and situation. 
4. No evidence of altered level of consciousness resulting from head trauma, medical illness, intoxication, dementia, psychiatric illness or other causes. 
5. No evidence of impaired judgment from alcohol or drug influence. 
6. No language communication barriers. Reliable translation available (e.g., on-scene interpreter, language line). 
7. No evidence or admission of suicidal ideation resulting in any gesture or attempt at self-harm. No verbal or written expression of suicidal ideation regardless of any apparent inability to complete a suicide. 


Definitions
       Minor: A person under the age of 18, who is not an emancipated minor (see below).
Emancipated Minor: For the purpose of making decisions regarding medical care and treatment, an emancipated minor is a person under the age of 18 who is

		1. married, widowed or divorced;
		2. the parent of a child;
		3. a member of the armed forces;
		4. pregnant or believes herself to be pregnant; or
		5. living separate and apart from a parent/legal guardian and is managing his or
 		her own financial affairs.

EMS providers will make every reasonable effort to convince reluctant patients to access medical care at the emergency department via the EMS system before accepting a refusal of medical care and ambulance transport.

Contact on-line medical control for all patients who present a threat to themselves, present with an altered level of consciousness or diminished mental capacity or have history or examination findings consistent with a high-risk refusal. The physician is to be provided with all relevant information and may need to speak directly with the patient by radio or preferably a recorded landline. 

Although a minor cannot legally consent to medical treatment, consent is legally implied in an emergency.  In assessing whether there is an emergency, particularly with regard to motor vehicle crashes, EMTs must include the mechanism of injury in their analysis.

Procedure
1.	Perform an assessment of the patient's medical/traumatic condition, and, to the extent 	permitted by the patient, a physical exam including vital signs. Your assessment, or the patient's   refusal of assessment, must be fully documented in the trip record.
2.	Explain to the patient the nature and severity of his/her illness or injury, the treatments
 	being proposed, the risks and consequences of accepting or refusing treatment, and the 	potential alternatives. Fully document the explanation given to the patient in your patient care report. 3.	Prepare and explain the refusal of medical care and ambulance transport document.
4.	Documentation of refusal of medical care and ambulance transport must be signed by the 	patient (or, in the case of a minor patient, by the minor patient's parent, legal guardian, or 	authorized representative) at the time of the refusal. Documentation should include, when 	possible, a signature by a witness, preferably a competent relative, friend, police officer, or 	impartial third person.
5.	The fact that the patient refused medical care and transport must be documented in the   patient care report, and the signed refusal of medical care and ambulance transport document must be 	included as part of the patient care report.
6.	If  medical control was consulted for a refusal of care, obtain and document the 	physician's name in the patient care report.

7.6 Sedation and Analgesia for Electrical Therapy-Adult & Pediatric
PARAMEDIC STANDING ORDERS 
* If cardioversion or pacing is warranted, consider administration of any ONE of the following for sedation:
*  Midazolam 
       o ADULT: 0.5 mg-2 mg IV/IO/IM/IN.
                                                                                    
                  o PEDI: 0.05mg/kg IV/IO/IM/IN.

* Fentanyl
o ADULT: 1 mcg/kg IV/IO/IM/IN weight based (kg) to a max of 150 mcg (150kg). 
     
* Morphine 
o ADULT: 0.1 mg/kg IV/IO/IM/SC (max dose 10 mg).

* Ketamine 
             o  ADULT: 0.1-0.5 mg/kg IV/IO slowly OR
             o  ADULT: 1 mg/kg IM, repeat in 5 minutes as needed to max of  2 mg/kg IM.
MEDICAL CONTROL MAY ORDER
   *    Contact medical control for further orders especially for children.

7.7 Withholding and Cessation of Resuscitation 

Purpose: 1) To clarify for EMS services and their EMTs when resuscitative measures may be withheld for patients in cardiac arrest and 2) to define when EMTs can cease resuscitative measures already initiated. 

Background and EMS Services' Training/Support Services Obligations: 
Emergency Medical Technicians must begin or continue resuscitative measures for all patients in cardiac arrest except as indicated in this Protocol (also issued as Administrative Requirement (AR) 5-515). If in doubt, begin resuscitative efforts. 

All EMS services must provide appropriate training on management of death in the field, including legal, procedural, and psychological aspects, and access to support services. 

EMS services and EMS personnel should be aware that the nursing staff of a health care facility, such as a skilled nursing facility, may need a physician order (including a medical control physician's order, if allowed by nursing home policy) to halt resuscitation attempts, even in the case of patients meeting EMS "obvious death" criteria, as set out below. Nursing staff and EMS personnel should come to a cooperative decision on continuation or termination of resuscitation; this process may include obtaining physician input and orders. If the medical professionals at the bedside are unable to reach agreement on attempting or terminating efforts, the presumption should be to continue resuscitative efforts and transport the patient to an emergency department. 

I. Exceptions to Initiation of Resuscitation 
Other than in overriding circumstances such as a large mass-casualty incident or a hazardous scene, the following are the only exceptions to initiating and maintaining resuscitative measures in the field: 
1. Current, valid DNR, verified per the Medical Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment (MOLST)/	    
Comfort Care Protocol. 
       2. Health care agent who is named in a health care proxy document for the patient  
            requests no resuscitative efforts on behalf of the patient, but only if 1) he or she is on  
            scene and 2) he or she has his/her health care proxy document in hand to show EMS. If  
            there is any doubt about the health care agent's authority, and none of the other  
            exceptions to initiation of resuscitation are present, EMS is to resuscitate the patient.
	3 Trauma inconsistent with survival 
		a. Decapitation: severing of the vital structures of the head from the remainder of the 		               patient's body. 
		b. Transection of the torso: body is completely cut across below the shoulders and 
		above the hips 
		c. Evident complete destruction of brain or heart 
		d. Incineration of the body 
		e. Cardiac arrest (i.e., pulselessness) documented at first EMS evaluation when such 
		condition is the result of significant blunt or penetrating trauma and the arrest is 
		obviously and unequivocally due to such trauma, EXCEPT in the specific case of
		arrest due to penetrating chest trauma and short transport time to definitive care (in 
		which circumstance, resuscitate and transport) 
	4. Body condition clearly indicating biological death. 
		a. Complete decomposition or putrefaction: the skin surface (not only in isolated 
areas) is bloated or ruptured, with sloughing of soft tissue, and the odor of decaying flesh. 
		b. Dependent lividity and/or rigor: when the patient's body is appropriately examined,
 		there is a clear demarcation of pooled blood within the body, and/or major joints 			(jaw, shoulders, elbows, hips, or knees) are immovable. 
		Procedure for lividity and/or rigor: All of the criteria below must be established and 
		documented in addition to lividity and/or rigor in order to withhold resuscitation: 

Exceptions to Initiation of Resuscitation, Continued
			i. Respirations are absent for at least 30 seconds; and 
       	ii. Carotid pulse is absent for at least 30 seconds; and 
       	iii. Lung sounds auscultated by stethoscope bilaterally are absent for at 			                   least 30 seconds; and 
       	iv. Both pupils, if assessable, are non-reactive to light. 
       
II. Cessation of Resuscitation by EMTs 
Emergency Medical Technicians must continue resuscitative measures for all patients in cardiac arrest unless contraindicated by one of the exceptions below. 
	1. EMTs at all levels of certification may cease resuscitative efforts at any time when any   "Exception to Initiation of Resuscitation" as defined in I., above, is determined to be present. 
       2. EMTs certified at the Paramedic level only may cease resuscitative efforts as per Protocol 6.10  
       Withholding and Cessation of Resuscitation by EMT Paramedic, if approved by your AHMD.
      
Special Considerations and Procedures: 
	1 a. If during transport, EMTs cease resuscitation of a patient in accordance with the requirements above, they shall continue to the closest appropriate hospital for pronouncement of death. This is always a special circumstance that is in the interest of public health and safety, and thus meets the requirements of 105 CMR 170.365. 
	1 b. During transports when resuscitative efforts have appropriately been ceased in accordance with the requirements above, EMTs must cover the person with a sheet, transport without the use of emergency vehicle audible and visual warning devices and notify the receiving hospital in advance.
                2. In all cases where EMTs have withheld or ceased resuscitative efforts in accordance with the requirements above, and left the person in the field, procedures must include notification of appropriate medical or medico-legal authorities, such as police. 
3. EMS patient care report documentation must reflect the criteria used to determine obvious death or allow cessation of resuscitative efforts. 
7.8 Ventricular Assist Devices (VADs)
EMT/ADVANCED EMT/PARAMEDIC STANDING ORDERS

PURPOSE
To provide an overview of how a Ventricular Assist Device (VAD) works and how EMS provider assessment and treatment differs for a patient with a VAD.
Highlights of Assessing and Treating a VAD patient
* Recognize that you have a patient with a VAD.
* Determine if your patient has a VAD problem, or an unrelated illness or injury.
* A completely stable patient may have no palpable pulse or measurable blood pressure.
* Mental status and skin color must be used to determine patient stability.
* CPR should almost never be performed on a VAD patient.
* Patients with a VAD should almost never be pronounced dead at the scene.
Overview of a VAD
The VAD, or Ventricular Assist Device, is a mechanical device that takes over some or all of the pumping function of the heart's left ventricle. This device is used for patients of any age or gender with advanced heart failure who would not otherwise survive without this device. Heart failure can result from chronic/long-term hypertension and heart disease, congenital heart defects, mechanical damage to the heart, infection, postpartum complications and many other reasons.

Some VAD patients will have a VAD while they are waiting for a heart transplant (called Bridge-to-Transplant). Other VAD patients, who are not eligible for a heart transplant for some reason, will live with the device for the rest of their lives (called Destination Therapy, or Lifetime use).

How the Heart Works versus How VAD works.
The normal pumping function of the heart is achieved by the contraction of the left ventricular muscle, which pushes a bolus of blood forward in the cardiovascular system with each contraction. This contraction is what we feel when checking a pulse, and what we hear when taking a blood pressure. If the heart is not contracting, blood is not moving forward in the system, and we don't feel or hear a pulse. The VAD, in contrast, flows constantly and therefore creates no "pulse" to feel or hear.

The VAD is a tube that is about 1/2 -1 inch in diameter with a pump in the middle. One end of the tube (inflow) is surgically inserted into the left ventricle, and the other end (outflow) is sewn into the aorta, just above where it exits the heart.

The pump on the VAD spins constantly. The right side of the heart still pushes blood through the lungs and back to the left ventricle, but then the VAD pump pulls the blood out of the left ventricle and pumps it out to the body, taking over most or all of the failed pumping action of the left ventricle.

The drive unit for the pump, which includes the power source and programming controls, is outside of the body and connects to the VAD by a cord that exits the body through the abdomen, usually in the right upper quadrant.

NOTE: The important part to us as EMS providers is that the pump is a constant flow pump. There is no rhythmic pumping as there is with the ventricle, and therefore there is little to no pulse. This means you can have a perfectly stable and healthy-looking person who has no palpable pulse and whom you may or may not be able to take a blood pressure!

Assessing the VAD Patient
1. Recognize you have a VAD patient!
The VAD patient has a control unit attached to their waist, or in a shoulder bag. The control unit is attached to a power cord exiting from the patients' abdomen. The control unit will be attached to batteries mounted to the belt, in shoulder holsters, or in a shoulder bag. At home, it could be attached to a long cord that connects to a large power unit.

2. DECIDE if you have a patient with a VAD problem, or a patient with a medical problem who just happens to have an VAD. Patients with VADs will have all the same illnesses and injuries as any other patient you see. Their VAD may have nothing to do with the reason you were called.

3. LOOK:
Alarms on the control unit will most likely indicate a VAD problem. Follow resource guides with the patient to trouble shoot. Skin color and mental status are the most reliable indicators of patient stability for VAD patients.

4. LISTEN:
Listen over the VAD pump location to make sure you can hear it running. This will be just to the left of the epigastrium, immediately below the base of the heart. You should hear a low hum with a stethoscope if the pump is running. Don't assume the pump is running just because the control unit looks OK. The patient and their family are experts on this device. Listen to what they have to say about any problems with the VAD.

5. FEEL:
Feel the control unit. A hot control unit indicates the pump is working harder than it should and often indicates a pump problem such as a thrombosis (clot) in the pump. The use of pulse and blood pressure to assess stability can be unreliable in a VAD patient, even if they are very stable.

6. VITALS:
Pulse: generally, you will be unable to feel a pulse.
Blood Pressure: you may or may not be able to obtain one, standard readings are unreliable and may vary from attempt to attempt. If NIBP machine can detect the blood pressure, adjust it to display Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP). This is a more reliable measure of perfusion and the calculation for MAP can overcome variations in standard readings. A MAP of 60-70 is normal.
Pulse-oximetry:  readings seem to be fairly accurate and consistent, according to data, despite the manufacturer stating that pulse oximetry often doesn't work.
Quantitative Continuous Waveform Capnography: This should remain accurate, as it relies on respiration, not pulse. Normal (printed) waveform shape with a normal respiratory rate and low CO2 readings (<30) can indicate low perfusion = poor pump function.
Temperature: infection and sepsis are common, check temperatures!

7.9 Process for Changes to the Statewide Treatment Protocols
       
All changes (any addition, deletion, or any other type of amendment) to the Massachusetts Statewide Pre-Hospital Treatment Protocols require statewide dissemination and often require training of EMTs and Medical Control physicians prior to implementation.  Therefore, to ensure a thorough review and orderly implementation, all protocol changes shall be approved and implemented on an ANNUAL basis, with the exception of those arising out of procedures described in Part B below.

Any protocol change must be approved pursuant to the following procedures.

PART A
Procedures for ANNUAL Protocol Changes

1.	All requests for protocol changes shall be submitted by at least one Regional Medical Director to the Medical Services subcommittee by October 1 of the preceding year.  The request for a protocol change shall include the following:
a.	A detailed description of the proposed change.
b.	A formal written endorsement from the Region(s) of origin for the proposed change.

2.	The Medical Services Committee shall review and make a recommendation regarding each proposed change to the protocols.  Where training is required for implementation of the protocol change, the Medical Services subcommittee shall timely distribute the approved protocol changes to the Training subcommittee for its approval of the training component.

3.	All protocol changes approved by the Medical Services Committee, with Training Committee approval of training if appropriate, shall be forwarded to the Executive Committee.  The EMCAB Executive Committee shall review the proposed protocol changes and make a final recommendation at its meeting.

4.	A presentation of the approved changes shall be made at the first meeting of the full EMCAB following the Executive Committee recommendation.

5.	Recommendations go to DPH/OEMS for review and final action. DPH/OEMS shall timely notify all providers of approved protocol changes and any requirements regarding implementation (i.e. training and implementation date).









PART B

Procedures for Protocol Changes Allowable Other Than on an Annual Basis

1.	The State EMS Medical Director shall have the discretion to implement immediate protocol changes when such action is deemed by the Department to be necessary for the protection of public health and safety.
a.	The State EMS Medical Director shall base such action on a thorough review of relevant literature, any applicable national and/or state standard(s) and, when feasible, consultation with EMS Regional Councils, the Medical Services subcommittee and/or the EMCAB Executive subcommittee.
b.	When feasible, the State Medical Director shall convene an emergency meeting of the Medical Services subcommittee.  The Medical Services subcommittee shall recommend any change to the protocols and refer its recommendation and all supporting documents relating to the proposed change to the EMCAB Executive subcommittee for action.  The EMCAB Executive subcommittee shall review the recommendation and make a final recommendation to DPH/OEMS.
c.	DPH/OEMS shall review such recommendation and take final action. It can also establish reasonable time frames for said implementation, particularly if a change requires training, and shall timely disseminate such a protocol change and any relevant implementation requirements.

2.	DPH/OEMS shall always have the discretion to make changes to bring the Protocols into compliance with national standards of care.
a.	This shall be done, when feasible, in consultation with Regional EMS Councils, the Medical Services subcommittee, and/or EMCAB Executive subcommittee.
b.	OEMS shall establish reasonable time frames for said implementation, particularly if a change requires training, and shall timely disseminate such a protocol change and any relevant implementation requirements.

OPERATIONS




Statewide Treatment Protocols 
Version 2024.1



8.1 Fire and Tactical EMS Rehabilitation

EMS Principles for Rehab at Emergency Incidents
EMS personnel may be designated by the Incident Commander (IC) at the scene of an emergency or training exercise to perform the function as rehab providers to assure the safety and well-being of the emergency responders, and the overall integrity of the operation. The need for establishing a Rehab Sector shall be based upon the duration, complexity, intensity of the incident and the climatic conditions, but shall not be the sole criteria for establishing REHAB.
The IC may establish a Rehab Manager as his/her designee. The Rehab Manager shall assure that all resources necessary to operate the Rehab Sector are communicated to the Logistics Officer or IC.  The Rehab sector shall provide rest for the emergency responders. Adequate resources for re-hydration, cooling/warming, medical screening, and accountability shall be available.  Multiple Rehab locations may be necessary based on the size of the incident. Each Rehab area shall have its own manager and identification, i.e.: Rehab 1, Rehab 2.
The Rehab Manager shall assure that adequate EMS staffing (paramedic level preferred) shall be available for responder screening and medical treatment if necessary.  A dedicated ambulance (ALS level preferred) shall be assigned to the Rehab Sector for the duration of the incident.  Easy access by EMS vehicles to the Rehab Sector shall be maintained at all times.
All emergency responders directed to the Rehab Sector by the IC shall be screened according to local protocol, and the attached "Rehab Flow Chart".   Any emergency responder who presents at the Rehab Sector with an acute medical condition shall be considered a patient under the definition of 105 CMR 170.020 and shall be treated in accordance with the appropriate Statewide Treatment Protocol. The Rehab Manager shall be responsible for tracking all responders entering and exiting the Rehab area, or who are transported from Rehab to a medical facility.





8.2 Multiple Casualty Management (MCI Triage)
	Each MCI/Disaster scene presents its own unique hazards and difficulties.  This plan is a general guide to the management of MCIs.  It should be understood that modifications may need to be made by command personnel on scene as such changes are needed. When the Statewide MCI plan is officially in place, nothing in this protocol shall be intended to replace or supersede the statewide plan.
	A multiple casualty incident (MCI) is any situation where the number of sick or injured patients exceeds the available local, regional or state EMS system resources to provide adequate care in a timely manner to minimize injury and death.  An MCI may be the result of a manmade disaster or a natural event.  Successful management of an MCI will require preplanning and organization of local, regional and state EMS, fire, law enforcement and emergency management resources.  CMED, Hospital resources and specialized care services must also be included in preparing your MCI plan.
	MCI management process is defined in the Incident Command System (ICS).  In general, the Fire Department or Emergency Medical Service Agency having jurisdictional authority establishes the overall command and designates the incident commander (IC) at an MCI scene.  NOTE: Other agencies may function as the IC, for example, Law Enforcement agencies at a crime scene or hostage situation.  Other agencies may assist the IC.  Clear precise inter-agency communication networks must be established for successful MCI management.
	MCIs within the Commonwealth assessed by EMS will be classified by levels.  Response to an MCI is based on the number of potential victims generated by the incident.  The following levels indicate the number of potential MCI casualties, should regional EMS providers require a mutual aid response:

       Level 1:        1-10 potential victims
       Level 2:        11-30 potential victims
       Level 3:        31-50 potential victims
       Level 4:        51-200 potential victims
       Level 5:        Greater than 200 victims
       Level 6:        Long-Term Operational period(s)

TRIAGE 
	Triage is a special process of sorting patients by the severity of injury or illness to determine the need of emergency care and transportation.  This needs to be a continuous process throughout the management of an MCI.  The initial triage process should be performed by the first crew to arrive on scene and needs to be continuously reevaluated since the patient's triage status may change.  Presently there are no national standard guidelines established for triage.  Massachusetts services in general will be using a form of the SMART TAG system, while New England services in general use START triage and compatible tagging methods. 
MCI triage and treatment priorities are generally defined as: 
Zero priority (BLACK): 	Deceased or live patients with obvious fatal and non-resuscitatable 					injuries 
First priority (RED): 	Severely injured patients requiring immediate care and transport. 	
			(e.g., respiratory distress, thoracoabdominal injury, severe head or 	
			maxillofacial injuries, shock/severe bleeding, severe burns) 
Second priority (YELLOW): Patients with injuries that are determined not to be immediately life 					threatening. (e.g., abdominal injury without shock, thoracic injury 	
			without respiratory compromise, major fractures without shock, head 					injury/cervical spine injury, and minor burns) 
Third priority (GREEN): 	Patients with minor injuries that do not require immediate 						stabilization. (e.g., soft tissue injuries, extremity fractures and 						dislocations, maxillofacial injuries 

Scene Assessment and Triage Priorities

1.	Maintain universal blood and body fluid precautions.
2.	The initial response team should assess the scene for potential hazards, safety and number of victims to determine the appropriate level of response.
3.	Notify agency dispatch to declare an MCI and need for interagency support as defined by incident level. Agency dispatch should coordinate requests for additional resources and contact local mutual aid, regional and state level agencies for assistance and notification as needed.
4.	Identify and designate the following positions as qualified personnel become available: EMS Command responsible for overall command of all EMS resources and tactics; Triage Officer responsible for overseeing all triage group activities; Treatment Officer responsible for overseeing all treatment group activities; Staging Officer responsible for overseeing staging of all arriving ambulances and other mobile EMS resources; Loading Officer responsible for overseeing loading of all treated patients into ambulances, buses and helicopters and logging patient info, tag numbers and coordinating hospital destinations with CMED.
5.	Identify and designate EMS sector areas of MCI including Triage, Treatment, Staging, and Loading.
6.	Post incident MCI Plan.

EMT, Advanced EMT and Paramedic MCI Procedure Summary

All EMT level personnel will eventually be involved in the management of an MCI.  It is imperative that all EMTs implement the above incident command system (ICS) in all MCI situations.  Every EMT must be aware and have a thorough knowledge of their particular role and responsibilities in the rescue effort.

Due to the many complexities of MCI/Disaster situations, it is recommended that all EMTs should participate and receive additional training in MCI/Disaster management.

Minimum Standards for Interfacility Transfers (IFTs):
1. Minimum Staffing, Training Requirements
The minimum staffing at the Advanced Level requires one Advanced EMT and one EMT-Basic. Minimum staffing at the Paramedic level requires one Paramedic and one Advanced EMT /EMT-Basic, in accordance with 105 CMR 170.305(C)(2).
EMS personnel providing patient care that exceed their regular scope of practice under the Statewide Treatment Protocols during IFTs must meet the following requirements as outlined in 105 CMR 170.000:
	a.	current certification as an EMT in Massachusetts.
	b.	completion of Department approved supplemental training that is specific to and 			consistent with levels of certification of involved EMTs and includes 
* expanded roles and responsibilities.
* additional, approved treatment modalities, equipment, devices, and technologies; and
* ambulance service policies and procedures and IFT Statewide Treatment Protocols. 
	c.	has maintained current authorization to practice from the Affiliate Hospital
       Medical Director.	
It shall be the responsibility of the transferring ambulance service to ensure and to verify appropriate training of its IFT EMS personnel.   This includes ensuring that its IFT EMS personnel have successfully completed IFT initial training, and thereafter, refresher training at a minimum whenever new IFT equipment or medication is approved for use. 

2.	Affiliation Agreements; Medical Control
	An ambulance service must be licensed at an ALS level by the Department to provide ALS IFT care, and it must maintain an affiliation agreement, in accordance with 105 CMR 170.300, with a hospital licensed to provide Medical Control Service by the Department, pursuant to 105 CMR 130.1501-130.1504 of the Hospital Licensure regulations. Such affiliation agreements must designate an Affiliate Hospital Medical Director (105 CMR 170.300(A)(2) and 105 CMR 130.1502(C)), whose medical oversight functions are defined in 105 CMR 130.1503. Standards for Affiliate Hospital Medical Directors are defined in 105 CMR 130.1504.

3.	Communications:
All communications by radio or phone with medical control must be recorded.

4.	Scope of Practice:
Under 105 CMR 170.360(A) of the EMS System regulations states, "No ambulance service or agent thereof shall transport a patient between health care facilities who is receiving medical treatment that is beyond the training and certification capabilities of the EMTs staffing the ambulance unless an additional health care professional with that capability accompanies the patient..." Depending on the patient's condition, there may be situations in which a physician or another health care professional's presence might be necessary; such determination shall be made by the medical control physician in consultation with the physician at the sending hospital.  
The scope of practice for each EMT level is defined (1) in regulation (105 CMR 170.810, 170.820 and 170.840), (2) by the U.S. Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) National EMS Scope of Practice Model and as used in its National EMS Education Standards, and (3) through the Statewide Treatment Protocols Appendix A1. 
	
     The following are patient condition classifications and corresponding requirements for EMT personnel during ambulance transport:
a.	Stable Patient - Routine, scheduled transport - Patient clearly stable for transport with no   requirement for airway management, no device in place that is actively running or requires any maintenance or monitoring and at no risk for deterioration.  Patient may have a device in place, but device must be locked and clamped, not require any maintenance and not be actively running. Such inactive devices may include, but are not limited to, IVs (if disconnected from fluid and on a saline lock during transport),- nasogastric tubes, feeding tubes, PICC lines, bladder irrigation and wound vacs (wound vacs that are self-contained, gravity draining or battery powered can be transported by BLS providers). Running PCA pumps are not inactive (for exceptions-see note below).
Note: This is the level of care needed for a patient with any device that will NOT require active intervention or management by BLS, unless ALS is otherwise required for patient management. If the device is being managed by the patient or accompanying caregiver, the patient or caregiver must have been trained in actually managing the device, not merely in its use; for example, the patient or caregiver must have the knowledge and ability to stop a PCA pump, if the line is damaged.	
Minimum Staffing:  BLS licensed ambulance service; two EMT-Basics.

b.	Stable Patient at low risk of deterioration - Patient clearly stable for transport (as above) who has a "maintenance" IV running without additives; (e.g., cancer patient transported for radiation therapy, with unadulterated crystalloid IV solution running). Advanced EMTs may transport patients with Dextrose-containing IV solutions.
	Minimum Staffing:  ALS-Advanced EMT licensed ambulance service; one Advanced EMT attending patient care and one EMT-Basic driving.

c.	Stable Patient with medium risk of deterioration - Patient with an acute or subacute problem, who is either completely or, at least, to the best of a facility's ability, stabilized, who has the potential to become less stable during transport.  Instrumentation or medication running must be consistent with the IFT Guidelines. This is the minimum level for running PCA pumps.
Minimum Staffing: ALS-Paramedic licensed ambulance service; one Paramedic and one Advanced EMT or EMT-Basic, in accordance with 105 CMR 170.305(C)(2). The EMT with the highest level of certification must attend patient care.
	
d.	Patient with high risk of deterioration or unstable - Patient with an acute problem with high potential to become unstable or cannot be stabilized at the sending facility - 
e.   Critical care patient. Critical Care patients require critical care transport (CCT). See Part B, Determining the Need for CCT
Minimum Staffing: CCT-licensed ambulance service. In the event CCT is unavailable, the sending facility must send appropriate additional medical personnel (per 105 CMR 170.360(A)) to accompany the patient during transfer and assume responsibility for patient care, in an ALS-paramedic-licensed ambulance at staffed with a minimum of two paramedics.  
NOTE:  The sending hospital's medical personnel, such as a nurse, physician, of respiratory therapist (the latter only for ventilator management only), accompanying the patient must be able to manage all equipment and instrumentation associated with the patient's care and provide advanced resuscitative measures if needed. Such sending hospital's additional health care professional would be responsible for primary patient care of that patient during transport and would receive any additional orders from the sending physician, since the care of the patient exceeded what the ambulance and its crew could provide. ​
	Note:  Under no circumstances shall EMTs function or be assigned to transfers beyond, or potentially beyond, the scope of their training and level of certification.  The scope of practice for all EMTs is limited to the levels of EMT certification and training and by licensure level of the ambulance service by which they are employed.
	
As a measure of last resort, in exceptional cases where CCT is unavailable and sending facility staff is unavailable, and the patient has a medical condition requiring time-sensitive intervention and it is approved by the Medical Control physician, the patient may be transferred by any level of certified EMS personnel; provided, that all interventions are within the scope of practice of the transporting EMTs and the licensed vehicle.  The Medical Control physician and sending physician must be in direct communication if there are any concerning issues prior to patient transport.

In these cases, the sending facility/physician must demonstrate he/she made every effort to secure a CCT-licensed ambulance, and failing that, to send appropriate hospital personnel and the patient condition is such that it is truly time sensitive that the patient be transferred to another hospital for appropriate care.  All such cases must be reported to the Affiliate Hospital Medical Director of the ambulance service that provides the transport, for quality assurance review.  
 
5.	Continuous Quality Assurance/Quality Improvement
	a. Ambulance services providing ALS IFT shall be required to have continuous quality assurance/quality improvement (CQI/QI) policies specific to ALS IFT in conjunction with both their affiliate hospital medical directors and their ambulance service medical directors, if any, and include at a minimum:
* review of appropriateness of transfers, denials, and conformance with EMTALA regulations.
* review of critical skills (e.g., intubations, cardiac arrest management, IV therapy), and other measures of system function as deemed appropriate by the Department.
* steps for system improvement and individual remediation, available for Department review, of cases found to be deficient in critical interventions.
	
Patient ALS Transfer Procedure
Once an ALS IFT has been deemed appropriate by the transferring ambulance service (see "Scope of Practice" above), paramedic staff, upon arrival at the transferring facility, will:
* receive a report from the staff of the transferring facility.
* assess the patient; and
* in cases where the patient's care during the transfer exceeds the standing-order scope of practice for a paramedic or the patient is unstable or is likely to become unstable as defined previously (see "Scope of Practice" above), the paramedic will provide a concise, complete and accurate patient report to a Medical Control Physician, according to the ambulance services and the Affiliate Hospital's policies and procedures.  When EMS personnel have a concern regarding the safety of the patient being transferred, the paramedic will contact a Medical Control Physician for guidance.
The report should include, at a minimum, the following information:
	a.   Names of transferring and receiving facilities.
	b.   Patient's diagnosis.
	c.   Reason(s) for transfer.
	d.   A brief history of present illness and any intervention(s) which has occurred to date.
	e.   Pertinent physical findings.
	f.    Vital signs.
	g.   Current medications and IV infusions.
	h.   Presence of or need for additional medical personnel.
      i.    Anticipated problems during transport, if any. 
      j.    Anticipated transport time; and
      k.   Staffing configuration of the transporting ambulance

NOTE:  Complete copies of all pertinent medical records, including X-Rays, CT Scans, consultative notes and ECGs, as available, must accompany the patient to the receiving facility or be electronically transferred to the receiving facility.

When necessary, the Medical Control Physician and paramedic will discuss with the sending physician the orders for maintenance of existing and/or addition of new therapies according to the needs of the patient, within the scope of existing treatment protocols and EMT scope of practice.  The Medical Control Physician will be responsible for all actions/interventions initiated by the EMS personnel during transport unless the referring physician accompanies the patient.

If the sending physician is unavailable, or the patient is unstable, the Medical Control Physician may recommend to the sending facility additional therapies prior to the transfer of the patient in the interest of patient safety and quality care.  

In some situations, consistent with the intent of EMTALA, the transfer of a patient not stabilized for transport may be preferable to keeping that patient at a facility incapable of providing stabilizing care.  If the transferring facility cannot provide appropriate medical care or appropriately trained and experienced personnel to accompany the patient, alternative means of transfer, including a CCT-licensed ambulance service, must be utilized.  The use of a local primary ambulance service is strongly discouraged in such a situation.  All such responses must be reported by the ambulance service to the Department's Division of Health Care Facility Licensure and Certification for review.  It is primarily the responsibility of the sending physician and Medical Control Physician to determine the appropriate method of transferring an unstable patient.

When a facility sends its own staff with the patient during transfer (additional personnel) and the patient's condition deteriorates during transport, EMS personnel must contact the Medical Control Physician for appropriate intervention orders and notify the receiving facility of the change in patient status.

If the accompanying staff is an RN s/he will maintain patient care responsibility, functioning within his/her scope of practice and under the orders of the sending physician.  The paramedic and the RN will work collaboratively in the provision of patient care.  If the patient's condition deteriorates enroute, the Paramedic may assume full responsibility in conjunction with their medical control physician for care that exceeds the RN's scope of practice and/or the sending physician's medical orders.  Prior to transfer with an RN, the paramedic will contact the Medical Control Physician to discuss the sending physician's orders and rationale. 

If the accompanying staff includes a physician from the transferring facility, that physician shall be in charge of patient care.  Prior to transfer, the paramedic will contact the Medical Control Physician to coordinate patient care between the sending physician accompanying the patient, the Medical Control Physician, and the paramedic.  Clear lines of command and responsibility shall be established prior to transport.  

Interstate ALS IFTs
During interstate IFTs, paramedics must obtain medical control through the normal channels of the ambulance service for which they are working.  Appropriate provisions for re-contacting the Medical Control Physician during transport, if necessary, should be made prior to departure from the sending facility. If a transfer originates out of state and no contact with a Medical Control Physician is possible, the transfer should be made at the BLS level only with appropriate additional personnel provided by the sending facility.














Part B-Determining the need for CCT
B1 - Pediatric Patients (14 years of age or younger and/or weighing no more than 40 kg)
❑ Any neonate (30 days or younger) requiring transfer for evaluation and/or treatment of an UNSTABILIZED acute condition.
❑ Any pediatric patient with critical illness or injury.
NOTE: MEDICAL CONTROL should be involved in determining whether   pediatric patients require critical care.
❑ Any pathology associated with the potential for imminent upper airway collapse and / or
obstruction (including but not limited to airway burns, toxic inhalation, epiglottitis,
retropharyngeal abscess, etc.). If any concerns whether patient falls into this category,
contact MEDICAL CONTROL.
❑ Any pediatric patient requiring acute ventilatory support (NIV, high flow NC, ventilator, etc.) who requires an interfacility transfer.
❑  For patients 2 months or older, Paramedic transport may be indicated in place of CCT         
      for patients requiring hi flow nasal cannula if the patient is receiving an FiO2 <50% or less  
      and has an SpO2 of ≥ 92% and is stable on such settings for 20 minutes. Such transport 
      must be agreed to by sending physician and Medical Control. 
❑ All conditions that apply to adult medical patients also require CCT for the pediatric patient.
NOTE: On-line MEDICAL CONTROL should be involved in determining whether pediatric
patients require critical care.

B2 - ADULT MEDICAL PATIENTS
* Unless approved by MEDICAL CONTROL, patients requiring more than three (3) medication infusions by IV pump, not including maintenance fluids must be transported by CCT.
* Unless approved by Medical Control, any patient receiving more than one IV medication being actively titrated to affect heart rate or blood pressure must be transported by CCT. 
* Any patient who is being actively paced (either transvenous or transcutaneous) must be transported by CCT.
* Patients being transferred due to an issue with a ventricular assist device that may require active monitoring or management.
* Patients with an intra-aortic balloon pump.
* Any patients with a pulmonary artery catheter.
	NOTE: Central lines may be transported by ALS IFT.
* Any patient with an intracranial device requiring active monitoring.
	NOTE: Except for chronic use devices, such as ventriculoperitoneal shunts, etc.
* Any pathology associated with the potential for imminent upper airway collapse and / or obstruction (including but not limited to airway burns, toxic inhalation, epiglottitis, retropharyngeal abscess, etc.). If any concerns whether patient falls into this category, contact MEDICAL CONTROL.
	NOTE: If any concerns about whether patient falls into this category, contact MEDICAL CONTROL.
* Any patient being artificially ventilated for ARDS or Acute Lung Injury. 
Part C - General Protocols for ALS Interfacility Transfer Care
* Vital signs should be obtained and documented every ten (10) minutes, unless otherwise required by protocol.
* If clinically indicated, patients will have continuous monitoring of electrocardiogram (ECG) and / or pulse oximetry (SpO2).
* All artificially ventilated patients (and all other patients where it is clinically indicated) will have continuous monitoring of waveform capnography. 
* The recommended route for medication infusions in the ALS IFT setting is the peripheral intravenous (IV) line. Intraosseous (IO) lines may also be used.
* Medications may also be administered through any central venous catheter.
* Paramedics may administer medication boluses, infusions and fluids through administration sets connected by the sending facility to subcutaneous devices (e.g., Port-a-Cath)
* Patients who are being transferred ALS between facilities should have peripheral intravenous (IV) access, if possible.
* Paramedics should attempt to establish IV access if no attempts have been made at the sending facility. Paramedics are authorized to establish IO access if warranted by the patient's condition.
* All monitoring and therapy will be continued until care is transferred to the receiving medical staff.
* Paramedics may not accept any medications from the sending facility for the purposes of bolus administration during transport.
* Any patient who qualifies for spinal immobilization per pre-hospital statewide treatment protocols who has not been cleared by CT scan or appropriate physician assessment must be properly immobilized for transport. If there is identification of a clinical concern of thoracic or lumbosacral spine injury, the patient should be immobilized with a long board and log roll precautions used at all times.
* If any confusion arises regarding the need for spinal immobilization MEDICAL CONTROL will be 	contacted and the MEDICAL CONTROL physician and the SENDING PHYSICIAN should be in direct 	communication.
*    If appropriately trained and authorized, EMTs may follow Protocol 6.4 Selective Spinal Assessment following consultation with the sending physician.
* Paramedics must be familiar with the treatments and interventions instituted at the sending facility.
* Patient care documentation should include, at a minimum:
* Patient's diagnosis / reason for transfer
* Brief history of present illness / injury
* Brief overview of interventions performed by sending facility.
* Pertinent physical examination findings and recent vital signs
* Current medications and IV infusions
* Presence of or need for additional medical personnel.
* For all patients being transferred to an emergency department, who are critically ill, unstable, or have a change in clinical status enroute, EMTs should notify receiving emergency department via CMED prior to arrival. If local CMED is unavailable, entry notes should be made by telephone (on a recorded line, if possible).
* Paramedics will contact on-line MEDICAL CONTROL for:
* Any intervention(s) that exceed the standing order scope of practice as defined by the 	current 	version of the Massachusetts Pre-Hospital Statewide Treatment Protocols for an 	EMT-Paramedic.
* Any patient that is unstable or is likely to become unstable.
* When there is any concern regarding the safety of the patient being transferred.
* Any significant patient care related questions or issues prior to transfer or en route.
* The MEDICAL CONTROL physician and SENDING PHYSICIAN should be in direct communication if there are any concerning issues prior to patient transport. 
* On occasion good medical practice and the needs of patient care may require deviations from these protocols, as no protocol can anticipate every clinical situation. In those circumstances, EMS personnel deviating from the protocols shall only take such actions as allowed by their training and only in conjunction with their ON-LINE MEDICAL CONTROL PHYSICIAN.
* It is recommended that central access and / or two large bore IV lines are in place prior to transport.
Part D1-Aortic Dissection
* Care during transport:
* Administer high-flow supplemental oxygen.
* Continuous cardiac monitoring
* Heart rate, blood pressure, neurologic evaluations documented every 5 - 10 minutes.
* Target heart rate = 60 - 80 bpm
* Target systolic blood pressure = 90 - 100 mm Hg
* Continually assess mentation.
* If the patient is outside of these parameters, contact MEDICAL CONTROL.
* Administer fentanyl for analgesia, per Protocol 2.13 Pain & Nausea Management Adult & Pediatric or by orders. 
* If not approved by on-line MEDICAL CONTROL prior to transport, you must contact MEDICAL CONTROL to adjust all medication infusions:
* Adjust vasoactive medications initiated at sending facility (until systolic blood 	pressure is less than 100 mm Hg and/or MAP is less than 60 mm Hg):
* If labetalol infusion has been initiated by sending facility, increase by 2 mg / minute,  
                            every 10 minutes (to a maximum of 8 mg/minute)
* If esmolol infusion has been initiated by sending facility, increase by 50 mcg / kg / minute every 4 minutes (to a maximum of 300 mcg / kg / minute)

* Notify issuing hospital's blood bank of any suspected reaction.

Part D3-CVA post tPA
* Seizures (either generalized motor or nonconvulsive) should be quickly controlled.
* After assessing airway, breathing, and applying high-flow oxygen:
* Follow Seizure protocols: 
			2.15A Seizures - Adult and 2.15P Seizures - Pediatric
* For an ischemic CVA, if a tPA (tissue plasminogen activator) infusion will be continued during the transport, follow these guidelines:
* Sending facility staff should withdraw excess tPA from the bottle, so that the bottle will be empty once the full dose has infused.
Example:  100 mg bottle of tPA contains 100 mL of fluid when reconstituted; if the total dose being administered is 70 mg, then the facility should remove 30 mL of fluid from the bottle before departure.
* When the pump alarm indicates that the bottle is empty, you should take the
following steps to ensure that the drug contained within the administration tubing
is administered to the patient:
* Remove the IV tubing from the tPA bottle and spike a bag of 0.9% NS
                and restart the infusion; the pump will stop infusing when the preset volume
                has been administered.
* If systolic blood pressure is found to be greater than 180 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure is found to be greater than 105 mm Hg consult MEDICAL CONTROL, then:
* Adjust antihypertensive medications initiated at sending facility:
* If labetalol has been initiated by sending facility;
* Increase by 2 mg/minute every 10 minutes (to a maximum of 8 mg/minute) until systolic blood pressure is less than 180 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure is less than 105 mm Hg
* Discontinue drip and contact medical control for instructions if the reduction in MAP is greater than 30% of initial BP or SBP < 140 mm Hg, DBP < 80, or heart rate < 60 bpm
* If nicardipine has been initiated by sending facility;
* Increase by 2.5 mg / hour every 5 minutes (to a maximum of 15 mg /hour) until systolic blood pressure is less than 180 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure is less than 105 mm Hg
* Discontinue drip and contact medical control for instructions if the reduction in MAP is greater than 30% of initial BP or SBP < 140 mm Hg, DBP < 80, or heartrate < 60 bpm
* For any acute worsening of neurologic condition (e.g., acutely worsening neurological deficits, development of severe headache, acute hypertension, vomiting, etc.):
* If the patient is receiving tPA, discontinue the infusion.
* Contact MEDICAL CONTROL for further instructions, including possible change in      
            destination.
* Contact receiving hospital emergency department with an update on patient's condition and an estimated time of arrival.
Part D4-Post-Arrest Targeted Temperature Management (TTM)
* If post-arrest targeted temperature management (TTM) therapy in progress at the time of IFT ALS arrival, it should be continued during the transport.
* Pre-transport temperature should be documented, and temperature should be monitored with vital signs every five minutes.
* The temperature target for post-arrest targeted temperature management (TTM) is 32°C - 36°C (89.6°F - 96.8°F).
* If pre-transport or inter-transport temperature is less than or equal to 36°C:
* Maintain temperature with cold packs placed in the groin, axillae, and on the chest   
                 and sides of neck.
* If pre-transport or inter-transport temperature is greater than 36°C:
* Continue cooling with cold packs placed in the groin, axillae, and on the chest and sides of neck.
* Temperature should be monitored, if possible, for transport times longer than 20 minutes.
Patients should be handled gently (due to risk of arrhythmias).
* ALS IFT crews will not discontinue TTM unless ordered to do so by MEDICAL CONTROL.
* If a patient's temperature is less than 31°C, contact MEDICAL CONTROL and utilize any external warming devices (blankets, etc.) to actively rewarm patient until the temperature is greater than 31°C.
* If ordered by MEDICAL CONTROL and available, consider infusion of 250 mL IV boluses of warmed normal saline solution, until the temperature is greater than 31°C.
* If hemodynamically significant dysrhythmias or bradycardia of any type develop, or if the patient develops significant bleeding, TTM should be stopped, MEDICAL CONTROL contacted, and active rewarming pursued.


Part D5- Pregnancy Related
* Patients who are in labor with concern for imminent delivery must be accompanied by sending facility staff.
* In high-risk situations, a physician/registered nurse will accompany the patient for transport.
* If any confusion arises regarding the need for additional OB staff MEDICAL CONTROL will be contacted and the MEDICAL CONTROL physician and SENDING PHYSICIAN should be in direct communication.

* Document that the fetal heart rate was evaluated prior to transport and upon arrival.
* If patient should develop eclamptic seizures:
* After assessing airway, breathing, and applying high-flow oxygen:
* Administer magnesium sulfate 2-4 grams over 5 minutes IV/IO.
Follow Seizure Protocol 2.15A - Seizures-Adult and the OB protocol 2.10 Obstetrical Emergencies. 


Part D6-ST Segment Elevation MI (STEMI)
*   Paramedics should be familiar with the care and treatment the patient has received.
      Confirm medications administered prior to arrival.

* Consider discontinuing or avoiding all medication infusions (except for basic IV fluids) to expedite transfer.
* Receiving facility should be contacted to ensure rapid transfer to cardiac cath lab.
* Patients should receive appropriate supplemental oxygen therapy, only if SpO2 <94% or dyspnea, in accordance with Routine Patient Care 1.0. 
* All other interventions per state-wide treatment protocol, if not already administered:
* Aspirin 324-325 mg PO
* If patient continues to experience chest discomfort:
* Nitroglycerine (if systolic blood pressure is greater than 120mm Hg), 0.4 mg SL

* If any signs and symptoms of transfusion reaction, proceed immediately to the TRANSFUSION REACTION PROTOCOL (Part D2).
* When the transfusion has finished:
* Record transfusion end-time and post-infusion vital signs.
* Disconnect infusion set tubing from primary line.
* Flush primary line with normal saline only.
* Place any used supplies into a clean biohazard marked container or bag.
* Deliver all empty transfusion bags and tubing to the receiving facility with the patient.


Part F1-Mechanical Ventilators
* All artificially ventilated patients must be transferred on a ventilator.
* Consider sedation/analgesia, remember that paralysis is not sedation!
* All ventilators must be able to meet the demands of the patient's condition, taking into consideration all settings and features described or stipulated by the sending facility and / or physician.
* Ventilators may not be full control mode only and must be capable of meeting the patient's ventilatory needs. Ventilator settings must be documented in the Patient Care Report. 
* Unless the transfer is time sensitive in nature (e.g., STEMI, aortic dissection, acute CVA, unstable trauma, etc.), the following requirements apply to ventilator use and / or adjustment:
* Patients must be observed, by the sending facility, for a minimum of 20 minutes after 	any adjustment in ventilator settings.
* Patients should be on the transport ventilator for 20 minutes prior to departure.
* MEDICAL CONTROL may waive 20-minute rule based on patient condition and needs, if utilized, must be documented on Patient Care Report.
* On-line MEDICAL CONTROL is required for any instance when adjustment of the ventilator settings is needed.


Part F2-Intravenous Pumps
Paramedics who operate at the ALS IFT level are expected to have a thorough understanding of the functions and operations of the infusion pump they will utilize (whether property of the ambulance service or sending facility). 
Paramedics are expected to not only control the basic functions of the pump, but also be able to dynamically troubleshoot pump issues. Prior to transport, paramedics must be proficient at the following:
* How to turn the pump on and off.
* How to load and safely eject the administration set into pump.
* The importance of having spare tubing.
* How to suspend pump operation.
* How to adjust the infusion rate, if necessary.
* How to clear air bubbles from the tubing.
* How to troubleshoot problems (e.g., occlusion alarms).
* How the specific service addresses low battery or power issues.
It is strongly recommended that paramedics be trained and practiced on the infusion pump they will be using in the field.











Part F3-Pleural Chest Tube Monitoring
* Obtain and document the indication for placement of the pleural chest tube.
* Ensure that the chest tube is secured to the patient, and that the drainage system remains in an upright position and below the level of the patient's chest at all times.
* Regularly evaluate lung sounds and vital signs.
* Signs and symptoms of a tension pneumothorax include the following: Dyspnea, tachypnea, decreased / absent lung sounds on affected side, hypotension, tachycardia, jugular venous distention, tracheal deviation (late sign)
* Tubes and connections should be evaluated following any movement of the patient to ensure leak-proof operation and chest tube patency.
* Check the following initially and after moving the patient:
* Ensure the dressing remains dry and occlusive.
* Ensure there are no kinks or dependent loops (e.g., a loop or turn in the tubing that
            forces the drainage to move against gravity to reach the collection chamber) in the    
            tubing.
* Amount of water in the water seal chamber; if the water level appears low ask a staff  member if it requires refilling prior to departure.
* Monitor the following items after routine assessment of patient's vital signs:
* Drainage (document the appearance and amount of fluid, at the start and at the conclusion of transport)
* Bubbling in the water seal chamber
* Gentle rise and fall of the water level, which corresponds with the patient's respirations  
                              is called "tidalling" and indicates that the system is functioning properly.
* Troubleshooting / problems
* Abnormal bubbling in the water seal chamber
* Remember, gentle rise and fall of the water level, which corresponds with the patient's respirations is called "tidalling" and indicates that the system is functioning properly.
* Continuous air bubbling confirms a constant air leak from a tube connection or from the patient's chest (e.g., unresolved pneumothorax).
* Intermittent bubbling confirms an intermittent air leak from the patient's chest.
* No air bubbling confirms no air leak from the patient's chest and no air leak from a tube connection.
* If the entire chest tube is removed from the chest: Cover with a three-sided dressing and contact MEDICAL CONTROL.
* If the chest drainage system tips over and spills: Contact MEDICAL CONTROL; you may be instructed to clamp tube.
* If the chest drainage system is crushed or broken open, or the chest drain becomes detached from the chest tube: Contact MEDICAL CONTROL immediately, do not reconnect; you may be instructed to place the end of the chest tube in a bottle of sterile water to create a seal.
